 * However, the actual code for the various options is quite small, as is the

   * Element 1, level 0, days 0: Players at level 0 have created a character,
     but have never actually entered the game, so always wipe them.
   * Element 2, level 1, days 4: Players at level 1 are wiped if they haven't
     logged on in the past 4 days.
   * Element 3, level 4, days 7: Players level 2 through 4 are wiped if they
     haven't logged on in the past 7 days.
   * Element 4, level 10, days 30: Players level 5-10 get 30 days.
   * Element 5, level LVL_IMMORT - 1, days 60: All other mortals get 60 days.
   * Element 6, level LVL_IMPL, days 90: Immortals get 90 days.
   * Element 7: Because -2 is less than LVL_IMPL, this is assumed to be the end
     of the criteria.  The days entry is not used in this case. */
