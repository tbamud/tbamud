  Updated World and files for 3.64 release.
[Feb 12 2013] - Vatiken
  feature: New group system.
  feature: Room events.
  bug: Many small bug fixes.
[Sep 08 2012] - Rumble
  added another example to doc/syserr.txt
  Added a !NPC check to can_take_object. It was spamming a "mob using player data SYSERR". 
This means mobs do not have a max weight carrying capacity anymore. I think this is a good 
thing because I've seen people stumped when mob triggers fail due to weight limitations. 
But it could be unbalancing on some MUDs since pets could then carry unlimited gear.

tbamud 3.56
[Apr 07 2008] - Rumble
  Fixed typos in lib/misc/messages and socials.new
[Apr 04 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Minor Bugfix: All game configuration settings now reference the world config
structure, not the individual config variables found in config.c.
[Mar 22 2008] - Rumble
  Added lib/world/qst/ directory, index, index.mini, and 0.qst.
[Mar 08 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Bugfix: the include directory (for .h files) is now referenced correctly in 
the depend statement.
  Deletion: listrent.c removed as a separate utility.
[Mar 07 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Enhancement: utils/ Makefile will now use a depends file, and looks for 
dependencies in the ../ directory (shrinks the necessary information to make 
each utility).
[Mar 06 2008] - Rumble
  Made TBA specific changes. do_cheat, removed help level checking, and 
advance to level 32 (these will be removed for releases).
[Mar 05 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Minor Update: Changed header of Makefile.in to read 'tbaMUD' and also added 
in attribution for the changes. (Thanks seqwith.)
[Mar 05 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Changed Makefile.in to use glob expressions when building the objects. This 
translates into no longer a need to update Makefile.in whenever a new .c file 
is added to the mud code. Other Makefile.* have not yet been changed (and 
need review, anyway).
  All CXREF cruft left in Makefile.in has been removed. tbaMUD is now using 
Doxygen. Technically, CXREF provides a bit more auto-documentation than Doxygen
does, however the tbaMUD (and legacy circle code) has never been marked-up with 
the special CXREF codes required to effectively use the program. Since Doxygen 
is easier to use, and provides almost as much functionality as CXREF, CXREF 
support has been dropped.
  Bug Fix: asciiflag_conv* functions now can handle a negative numeric value.
  Bug fix/enhancement: Charmed mobs (specifically charmed mobs with a ->master)
will no longer attempt to wander off.
  Based on the compiler warning about mag_materials being an unused function, 
and the clone spell being unused.
  Bug fix: Clone can now be cast. It is an 'ignore' target spell.
  Fix and Modification: Clone, being an effectively unused spell that is only 
used by mortal Magic Users at level 30, is now implemented as very simple 
example of how to use mag_materials(). The item required by mag_materials is 
vnum 161, which in stock tbaMUD is some sacrificial entrails.
  Bug Fix for "Did you mean:" including DG commands.
  Bug Fix: do_simple_move slightly rewritten to handle Leave triggers that 
purge a door.
  Documentation: do_simple_move documented.
[Mar 01 2008] - Laoris
  Trial run of columnizer function on commands list to see how people like it.
[Feb 26 2008] - jeremyosborne

#define SCMD_AUTOGOLD   25
#define SCMD_AUTOSPLIT  26
#define SCMD_AUTOSAC    27
#define SCMD_AUTOASSIST 28
  The Autoquest patch, along with a couple of minor bug fixes, has been 
integrated into tbaMUD. (Thanks Jamdog, Kenneth Ray and Morgaelin.)
[Feb 22 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Casted NOWHERE, NOTHING, NOBODY and NOFLAG as IDXTYPE for the signed short 
int index types.
[Feb 18 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Added a new atoidx() conversion function for dealing with string to IDXTYPE 
conversions (in utils.c, prototype exported through utils.h).
  Added IDXTYPE_MIN and IDXTYPE_MAX defines (in structs.h).
  Replaced atoi references with atoidx in do_oasis_zedit (in zedit.c).
  Since general olc editing are automatically saved to disk, 'shutdown reboot' 
has been changed to not-autosave by default. (Small change made to do_shutdown
in act.wizard.c).
  struct attack_hit_type moved to fight.h
  attack_hit_text exported through fight.h
[Feb 17 2008] - jeremyosborne
  do_file heads or tails files correctly and has also been enhanced to return
file info (act.wizard.c).
  Defines made for common log files created by autorun, and those used by 
do_file (db.h).
  utility functions added: file_head(), file_tail(), file_sizeof(), and 
file_numlines() (defined utils.c and exported through utils.h).
[Feb 16 2008] - Rumble
  Fixed export command. (thanks Kyle)
[Feb 15 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Files are now tagged as executable. Should be able to be checked out from 
subversion and executed without running chmod.
[Feb 14 2008] - Rumble
  Fixed strcat() writing out of bounds in cedit.c since strdup() only malloc()
strlen(str)+1 bytes. (thanks Buggo) and moved attack_hit_text back.

[Feb 13 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Event queue function definitions, global variables and defines doxygenated.
[Feb 12 2008] - Rumble

[Feb 10 2008] - Rumble

%actor.pref(FLAG)% checks. (thanks Jamdog)
[Feb 09 2008] - jeremyosborne
  COMPLETE: tbaMUD code re-org of global and local scope function and variable
declarations. There may be a few things that I did not catch (some non extern 
keyword declarations of function prototypes within other functions, for 
example).
  BUG FIX: Unused functions encrypt_hex() and decrypt_hex() removed from mail.c
[Feb 05 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Continued clean-up of 'extern' references to functions and variables.
  BUG UNCOVERED: set_title() in class.c incorrectly handles the const nature of
the char * returned from title_female and title_male.
  More work on mud clean-up.
  New file: spec_procs.h created to house the legacy special procedures 
(spec_procs.c and castle.c) and special feature assignment in general.
  Minor Bugfix: Fixed parse error in mobact.c
  Minor Bugfix: act.h is now included in all of the act functions. Forgot to do
that the first time :(
  Additions: ban.h has been added as the external entry point into the ban.c 
globals and functions. Files needing ban.h have been updated.
[Feb 04 2008] - jeremyosborne
  All act*.c functions, defines and globals have been prototyped/declared in 
act.h. The file act.h does not contain every ACMD, only those ACMDs and 
utility functions available within the act*.c files.
  Changed the 'struct queue' to 'struct dg_queue' to avoid namespace conflicts.
[Feb 04 2008] - Rumble
  Fixed the last few flags missed for the 128 bit conversion.
  Fixed run_autowiz which ran twice on advancement.

  Adding a column formatter for lists.  Accepts printf-like arguments.
Only used by medit right now.
[Feb 03 2008] - jeremyosborne
  act.h created and added. This header will be the external entry point for the
functions, function subcommands and variables within the act*.c files. It is 
not designed to be the entry point for all ACMD functions.
[Feb 02 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Marking all file scope functions as 'static'
  Reorganization of the global variables and functions.
[Jan 31 2008] - jeremyosborne
  Protected the conf.h.* system config files from multiple calls.
  Removed extraneous references to TRUE / FALSE and YES / NO defines.
  BUGFIX: NUM_POSITIONS set to 8 (was incorrectly set to 15 before)
  Migrated NUM_* settings from oasis.h to more appropriate locations near where
they are defined. (For Example: NUM_POSITIONS moved to structs.h next to the 
POSITION_* defines.)
  Added Appendix A - Coder Support. Right now, it simply speaks to the fact that
we have included doxygen config files, are working to document the source code, 
and provides a rudimentary "do this" guide to create the doxygen cross 
references.
[Jan 30 2008] - jeremyosborne
  All .h files now have doxygen recognized headers, and the format is slightly 
altered to ease editing of headers.
  Protected all .h files from multiple calls. (Standard format is #ifndef _HEADE
R_H_ #define _HEADER_H_ .... #endif)
[Jan 29 2008] - jeremyosborne
  constants.h, structs.h and utils.h now protected from multiple includes. This
is sometimes overkill, but good practice overall.
  Updated documentation for constants.c and constants.h.
  The standard Doxygen configuration doxyfiles (config files) for tbaMUD. One
is to be used with the Graphviz DOT (dox_withGraphs), one is designed to be 
used if Graphviz is not available.
  Minor document correction in struct dex_app_tpe.
[Jan 28 2008] - jeremyosborne
  *bugfix* do_drink command: When a container is empty, the correct, "It is 
empty." message is now displayed.
