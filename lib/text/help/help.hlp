%PURGE% OPURGE MPURGE WPURGE

%purge% <victim>

   Purge removes objects or mobs from the game. If no argument is given, then
all objects and mobs in the room will be removed. If there is an argument,
only that mob or object will be purged. Players can not be purged.

Examples: 
   %purge% %self%
   %purge% %actor.inventory(1300)%   
   %purge% %actor.eq(hold)%
 
When purging objects make sure the object exists. If it does not the room will 
be purged:

if %actor.inventory(700)%
  %purge% %actor.inventory(700)%
end

Always purge at the end of a trigger. If you purge a mob/obj at the beginning
you can no longer access that mob/obj variables.

%TRANSFORM% MTRANSFORMS OTRANSFORMS TRANSFORMS MORPHS MTRANSFERS TRIG-MOB-TRANSFORM 

%transform% < vnum | -vnum >

   This command causes the executing mob or object to transform into another 
mob or object, based on the vnum argument supplied. The transformation is 
permanent, though additional transformations may be performed. No message 
regarding the transformation is sent to the room. The new mob or object will 
have the same trigger as the original, rather than any trigger normally assigned 
to the new, and no load trigger will be executed.

   Mobs - The hit points, max hit points, position, gold, and experience value 
will remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions 
will be those of the new mob. (The mob can be made to have all of its normal 
statistics by using a negative vnum.) Only mobiles may use this command (naturally).

   Objects - Based on the vnum argument supplied. The four basic values will 
remain those of the original mob but all other statistics and descriptions will 
be those of the new object. The transformation is permanent, additional 
transformations may be performed. No message regarding the transformation is 
sent to the room. The new object will have the same trigger as the originating 
object, rather than any trigger normally assigned to the new object, and no 
load trigger will be executed.

Example: @RTSTAT 21, 1370@n

@@

The @ character is used as a colorcode. If you see it, try toggling color to
complete. If this still does not work you must not be able to view colors.

To print a single @* follow it with the * (asterisk).

Many people have asked why use the @ as colorcodes while others use &. 
Welcor of TBA changed this because of trigedit. A builder who enters:
if %actor.is_pc% && %arg% would only see: if %actor.is_pc% & %arg%. No 
big deal, but this could get confusing to newbies when you tell them AND 
needs 2 & and they will only see &. The second problem is that trigedit 
also uses the special character & to denote mob/obj pronoun: IT, YOU, 
HE/SHE: &%obj%. So putting in colorcodes in echos returns garbage itititit
etc. if done improperly. The fix is to use the escape character \&<colorcode> 
in trigedit.

AC-CONFIDENCE ARMOR-CLASS ARMOUR-CLASS AC-APPLY 

   Your Armor Class (often called AC) is an expression for how good your armor
is at protecting you.  When you don armor, any AC apply that armor has is 
subtracted from your standard (naked) AC value, modified depending on where on
the body you are wearing the armor.  Some items have a special bonus, and 
subtract from the AC directly. Negative AC is better. Modifiers: Body X3, 
head and legs X2.

AGE

How old your character is. Your age begins at creation and continues whether
you are logged in the MUD or not.

ALIASES

Usage: alias [alias name] [command]

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

  > alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

  > alias gbb get bread bag
  > alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

  > alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

  > alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.

Examples:

  > alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
  > killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

  > alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

  > alias tr tell Rumble $*
  > tr hi there, how are you today?
  You tell Rumble, 'hi there, how are you today?'

A quick note on some possible problems with aliases:
Several MUD client capture semi-colons for their own new-line so they are not 
sent to the MUD.  For Zmud click on the computer on the bottom right of the 
screen to disable text-parsing.  Here is one of my many aliases.  They are a 
life-saver.  Everyone should learn how to use them well.
  
all              tlist $1;slist $1;olist $1;mlist $1;rlist $1;

I would type "all 13" to list everything in zone 13. I use this to check what
people have done with their zone.

ALIGNMENT GOOD NEUTRAL EVIL %ACTOR.ALIGN% %ALIGN% %ALIGNMENT% 

   Different characters and mobs have different alignments depending upon their
way of life. Because of this, they may be aggressive or friendly depending on 
the mix. Some objects cannot be used by certain alignments. For mobs alignment 
ranges from:

 -1000 to -350  Evil
  -350 to  350  Neutral
   350 to 1000  Good

See also: ALIGNMENTS
#31
ALIGNMENTS

   Many good areas stick to a defined level range, such as 10-20 or 25-30. Do 
not try and make your new area cover the entire range of levels.  Every area
should have its moment in the sun. Conversely, it would be nice if there were
something really unique and challenging to do at every stage in a characters
history. Your area might be the most successful if you can gear it for a range
of levels that people believe is otherwise boring or neglected.
   You should always try to match your mobiles to the area and the players you
want to play there. For example, you should make the mobs in the area a 
similar level to the players you want to play there since a level X warrior
should be able to kill a level X mobile if the warrior is at full health. Also,
the quality of objects or mobiles should be matched with their level.
   Will your area be mostly good, neutral, or evil.  If it is mostly good or
mostly evil, is it strongly good or evil or just weakly aligned?  In any case
try not to make your area completely homogenous (equal). In neutral
communities there is going to be some evil and good elements, and likewise with
other communities. To some extent this goes along with the question about zone
level, consider what seem to be "gaps" among the zones in the world as far as
good or evil aligned areas for a particular level range, and try to fill those
needs. Everyone's first tendency is to make extremists--The ultimate evil hell
area, or the blindingly good paladin fortress. Keep in mind that there are
many layers in between, and these are often more interesting.

ANIMATE-DEAD

Usage: cast 'animate dead' corpse

   This spell will harness evil necromancy magic and bring life into a
corpse, creating a zombie.  The corpse will do the bidding of its master.

#0
ANTI

A flag with anti preceding it means that it cannot be used. Antimage would
not be useable my mages.
 
#0
APOSTROPHES

   The apostrophe is something else that is incorrectly used quite often. Here
are a couple of quick examples to show its uses:
 
Fred's sister is Doris.
Correct. This states that Fred has a sister named Doris.
Fred's sisters' dog is named Rover.
Correct. Rover is the dog that belongs to the numerous sisters of Fred.
Fred's sister's dog is named Rover.
Correct. Rover is the dog that belongs to the *single* sister of Fred.

Fyre asked his writing group about those possessive plurals and here is the
response from his top flight editor who makes her living in Switzerland
doing impressive loads of copyediting.

"The horses' manes" is correct; the "ess apostrophe ess" form is only used in
proper names: Travis's albums, Maris's pendants

My source is the Chicago Manual of Style, used in the majority of publishing
houses in the States.

And another supportive professor of English ... who has won several major
writing awards recently ...

"the horses' manes" is correct.  The possessive form of a plural word
that ends in "S" is formed by adding only an apostrophe.  The possessive form
of a plural word that does not end in "S" is formed by adding "apostrophe S,"
as in "women's hemlines."  

We rest our case. Now do whatever you want...after all, it is your area.

Usage: attach mob {trigger vnum/name} {mob name} [location]
       attach obj {trigger vnum/name} {obj name} [location]
       attach room {trigger vnum/name} {room vnum} [location]

   Attach lets you attach a trigger to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for
testing or other purposes. The command only attaches the trigger once,
and will not last over a reboot (or crash).

The 'location' is what number in the triggerlist the trigger will assume.
It is important to first attach a trigger to test before you manually add it
through oedit/medit/redit. 

Examples:
attach room 14500 14520 - Attaches room trigger 14500 to room 14520.
attach mob 1332 Santa   - Attaches mob trigger 1332 to mob 1308 (Santa).
attach obj 1480 sword   - Attaches obj trigger 1480 to a sword.

BACKDOOR HACKING 

   Not a good thing to be searching for help on. Your IP address has been logged

actually very stable. I have never heard of one being hacked except via weak or
compromised passwords.

BACKSTAB

Thief only.

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your dagger
in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage.  A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on your level:

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab at your guild.  You can always backstab sleeping
people.

#0
BALANCE BALANCING

   "Game Balance" is a term that brings a different thing to mind for every
person that hears it. What is most important about game balance is to keep in
mind what each zone is designed for. For example, high-level players, newbies,
or small groups.  The objects and monsters found in the area should match the
level, abilities, and needs of the players expected to use the area. Most 
players do not like to be given vast treasure with no difficulty in getting 
it, but on the other hand, nobody likes to fight the most difficult mob on the
MUD and get nothing for doing it.  Zones should not be impossibly hard or
absurdly easy.    
   Understandably, builders want their zones to be popular, but they sometimes
attempt to achieve this goal by purposefully making their zone unbalanced,
adding powerful weapons or armor with no harmful side-effects or mobiles that
are easy to kill yet give massive numbers of experience points.  Such zones are
destined both to become very popular and invariably to bring about the death of
the mud.  Every zone, every room, every object, every mob, will be checked
before being implemented into the game.  Do not waste everyone's time, (ours for
having to recheck your zone, and yours for having to fix any problems we find)
keep the balance.

BAN UNBAN

Usage: ban [<all | new | select> <site>]
       unban <site>

   These commands prevent anyone from a site with a hostname containing the
site substring from logging in to the game.  You may ban a site to ALL, NEW
or SELECT players.  Banning a site to NEW players prevents any new players
from registering.  Banning a site to ALL players disallows ANY connections
from that site.  Banning a site SELECTively allows only players with site-ok
flags to log in from that site.  Ban with no argument returns a list of
currently banned sites. Unban removes the ban.

Examples:
  > ban all whitehouse.gov
  > unban ai.mit.edu

BASH

Fighters only.

The success of a bash depends upon how many times you have practiced. To bash
someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed, you will
inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear.  The victim
will be unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence.  If you miss
you lose your balance and fall.

A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.

Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict 1.5 * damage.

BLEEDING

This is what happens when you use a color code and do not finish it with @@n

BREATHE BREATHING THINKING 

   My final words to you as a future builder, remember a few basic things. The 
chances you create the biggest are slim. The chances for creating the best are 
always there. Finally, this is not a job. This is for your enjoyment and the 
satisfaction that when you complete your area that hundreds of players will 
walk through the rooms and enjoy what you have created for them. There is never 
a rush. Relax, enjoy, learn, and do not forget to breathe.

#31
BRIEF

Usage: brief

Toggle "brief mode".  When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions of
the room you are in; only the name of the room and the people and objects
there.  Unless you're very familiar with the area in which you're traveling,
however, it is not advisable to use this command.  Frequently, you will find
small but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your
surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

If you explicitly type 'look', you will always see the full room description,
even in BRIEF mode.

BUILDERS IMMORTALS

   A builder is a term usually used to describe a person who designs MUD zones
for other characters to explore. Any player with motivation, ideas, and good 
writing style can be a builder as well as a player. As a Builder, your job is 
to create the virtual world in which players can roam around, solve puzzles, 
find treasures, and gain experience. A Builder creates the rooms, objects, 
mobs, shops, and triggers with which players will interact.

#31
BUILDWALKING BUILD-WALKING DIGWALK WALKDIG

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Usage: buildwalk

   BuildWalk is an OLC utility that will allow a builder to enable a
"buildwalking" mode.  In this mode, walking in a direction that doesn't exist
will find the next free room in the zone, create the room, and make a two-way
exit between the room the builder was standing in, and the new room. This way
a builder can create a framework of their zone by walking around.
   Buildwalking can be a little misleading. A builder can not walk n, e, s, w,
and end up in the same room they started. Buildwalk is not spatially aware of
other rooms. It will always create a new room if you walk in a direction 
without a current exit. It is often necessary to backtrack to prevent
overlapping rooms.

NOTE: Buildwalk does not autosave on exit. You must type SAVEALL. This way if
      you mess up and want the rooms deleted we can just reboot and wipe them.
      Be careful using buildwalk. If you mess up you will have a lot of rooms
      to delete.

BULLETINS BOARDS BULLETIN-BOARDS MESSAGE-BOARDS POSTING

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '/s' as the first characters on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Examples:
  > look at board
  > write Crash Bug I found!
  [writes the message; terminates with '/s']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

Boards are just a normal object with a special procedure attached in the

CARTOGRAPHY

   The reasons behind mapping are simple. It solidifies what you are planning 
to build into MUD terms. Also, though final products rarely are an exact copy 
of the map, they provide a concrete reference for you to look at when the 
builder's block question rears its ugly head "Hmm, what do I build next?" 
Lastly, not all players have nifty clients especially made for MUDding with 
automappers, etc. We would not want those poor unfortunate souls to be at
more of a disadvantage than they have to be... and maps are highly important 
to knowing a MUD, even if you keep them all in your head as a few players do.
   A specific map is required so that the rooms can be linked together in a 
way that makes sense geographically. It is the most annoying thing to be 
playing a MUD whose rooms are not geographically correct. A very important 
aspect of each room is the position of other rooms in relation to it. Great 
care should be given to making the rooms link logically. A player who moves 
north, east, south, west should find themselves back in the same room from 
which they started. Having an area geometrically correct makes it much easier
for a player to visualize it, and thus increases their enjoyment of it.

CIRCLEMUD CREDITS

tbaMUD (formerly known as CircleMUD) was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by 
Jeremy "Ras" Elson at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.
All code unique to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of 
the Johns Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it is impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

--Jeremy Elson

CLASSES

   There are 4 classes on tbaMUD. See the help files on each for details.

WARRIOR
MAGIC USER
CLERIC
THIEF

#0
CLEAR CLS

Usage: cls

Clears the screen.

#0
CLERIC

Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons.  Hence, they can
only wield bludgeoning weapons.  This class gives you the wisdom of peace,
blessing and healing, though it is possible to learn more violent spells.

You can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See @RHELP SPELLS@n for a list of spells available.

CODING C++ PROGRAMMING LINUX UNIX 

   Coding is far more difficult than building, to do it well requires years of
experience in programming and MUDding. TBA is willing to offer limited help in 
coding and setting up your own MUD. Be warned, it is not quick or easy and will
take years to create a decent MUD.

   To begin you first need a server to host the MUD. Since free servers are far
and few between I recommend new coders start with CYGWIN. Cygwin is a Unix like
server that runs under Windows on your own computer. To install follow the 
directions under @RHELP CYGWIN@n.

   If you are serious about coding then you will need to read up on it. I 
recommend the book "The C Programming Language" 2nd edition by Brian W. 
Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. There are also online tools like:

   If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use PREFEDIT to set the level of coloring you see.
   The letters for the colors are to be preceded by a single @* sign, where the
actual code will be @*<letter>. @** = single @*. All use of colorcodes @RMUST@n 
be terminated with @*n to restore normal color to prevent color bleeding.
 
ANSI colors:

COMMANDS MUDCOMMANDS MUD-COMMANDS

Usage: commands

The COMMANDS command gives a canonical list of all the known verbs.

Each command listed should have help available by typing "HELP <command>".

See also: SOCIAL, SOCIALS
#0
COMMENT * 

* This is an example of a comment in trigedit. Because of the *'s the lines 
* are not parsed, so the trigger still works even if it has a lot of 
* explanations built in. All triggers should be heavily commented.

* The below line sends the text 'Trigger firing' to the room.
%echo% Trigger firing

   Comments are useful in triggers to document what is happening, for future 
reference, and for others to see what the trigger does. If you want a * in your
trigger text try \*.

CONTAINERS BAGS CHESTS LOCKERS

   To create a container you must selected object type container and then
set the following to C) Values:

   value 0: Capacity (max containable weight) of container
   value 1: Container flag bitvector
     1)    CLOSEABLE      Container can be closed and locked.
     2)    PICKPROOF      Lock on container cannot be picked.
     3)    CLOSED         Container is closed when created.
     4)    LOCKED         Container is locked when created.
   value 2: The vnum of the key object that opens this container.
     -1 if it has no key.
   value 3: Reserved for internal use -- always set as 0.

Container capacity counts towards the total container weight.

See also: VALUES
#31
CONTEXT %CONTEXT% 

Usage: context <number>

* This little trigger will make sure one %has_said_hello% exist for each player.
context %actor.id%
set has_said_hello 1
global has_said_hello
* now only triggers running with context = %actor.id% can access this particular 
* variable. however - it is a better idea to use vars set on players: help remote.

   Changes the "context" of a trigger to this value. When first run, a trigger's 
context is 0. When a variable is made global, it is given the current context. 
When a variable is accessed, if it must be searched for globally, a "found" 
variable must either have context 0 or the current context. The net result of 
this is you may have many global variables in a single trigger, with the same 
name, differing only by context. Players may have variables; this mostly 
removes the need for variable context. Previously, a player's ID could be used 
as variable context to allow a trigger to service multiple players at once.

Example: @RTSTAT 23612, 13495@n

See also: REMOTE

D-DESC MEDIT-D-DESC MEDIT-EXTRA MEDIT-DESC

5) D-Desc:-
@yIt looks unfinished.@n
   The description displayed for a mobile when a player looks at the mobile by 
typing "look <mobile>." When entering this description you will use the text 
editor. So all commands under /h are once again available to you. As always 
with the text editor use /fi to format and indent your work. Try to liven up 
your mob by writing a creative description.
   Try to tell the player what the mobile looks like, how it is acting, etc...
Be careful how you word what they are wearing. For example of what not to say:
"A huge werewolf is wielding a mace of Oblivion." Reason being, if he does not
load the mace, this would not make any sense.

DEPENDENT ZEDIT-DEPENDENT DEPENDANT ZEDIT-DEPENDANT

   One of the most common mistakes by new builders is their misunderstanding
of: "Is this command dependent on the success of the previous one? (y/n)."
What this is asking is: does it rely on the command preceding it? Or do you
only want this to execute when the line prior to it does. For example if you 
are giving an object to a mob, equipping a mob, or putting something inside 
an object, IT MUST BE DEPENDENT on that mob/obj first loading. So you
should answer yes. IF you are loading a mob, closing a door or loading an
object to a room it would normally not be. There are too many instances to
describe every one so try to use common sense. When loading an object to a
mob maxload should be 99. Since the equip or give option in zedit will be
dependent on the mob first loading only 1 item will be given when it loads.
Unlike the load to room command where you should not set a maxload of 99
because 99 objects will load to that room.

DESCRIBING 

   Writing good descriptions requires inspiration and imagination before all 
else. There is nothing particularly difficult about writing for a MUD, but 
there are a number of common, fatal mistakes new builders typically make. If
you read through this tutorial, you should be able to avoid the common 
pitfalls, and thus insure a long life as a builder.
   Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive 
environment that the player sees, hears, feels, etc. This means that your 
number one goal is to be eloquently descriptive. 
   Writing for a MUD was once explained to me as writing a story for the 
mortals of the realm. As you go through the zone, it unfolds into different 
twists in the plot. Try imagining writing a small book when creating your 
descriptions. A few builders wing it, which I highly discourage. The best 
zones I have ever seen have always had much forethought and planning before
the builder process began. Do what works best for you, everyone has their own
style of building. Use it to your advantage.
   Use adjectives. Sad, Angry, Dirty, Nice, Morose, Gleeful, Enraged, Filthy,
Pleasant, Melancholy, Ecstatic, Pestilent, Comfortable, Depressing, Blissful,
Spiteful, Smutty, etc. A thesaurus is great for this. @Chttp://m-w.com/@n
   An interesting area will always attract more players than a bland one.  
There are many ways to make an area interesting.  Try to be as descriptive as
possible.  Do not hold back on writing extra descriptions.  Players are so
accustomed to not having richly described areas that finding an extra
description can often be a real treat.  Also, one oft forgotten thing to
describe is the door exits.  Describing all of these can give a feel of
standing out in a field and seeing something like: To the north there appears
to be a plume of smoke.  The fields stretch off towards the large hills on the
horizon.    
   Many players (both experienced and first timers) read the descriptions
carefully the first time they walk through an area, and having many extra
descriptions helps them fill out their idea of what things actually look like.
   When writing the numerous descriptions of the area, make them interesting 
to read! Nobody likes to read room after room of stupid one-line descriptions. 
Vary each description as much as possible. One of the greatest joys for most 
players is finding new and interesting rooms, items, treasures, and monsters. 
For those of you familiar with role-playing games, this creative use of 
descriptions and atmosphere should be quite well known to you. Consider 
looking over other areas you enjoy before building your own, to use ideas from
that area. Remember: You do not want to bore your players to tears.
   There are four types of descriptions a builder can make. Room, Mob, Obj and
extra. Room descriptions are simply what players see when they walk into a room.
Mob and Obj descriptions are what players see when they look at the Mob or Obj.
Extra descriptions are unique because they can be used on either rooms or
objects and can be seen when a player types "look <keyword>".

DETACH UNATTACH 

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   

Fizban: Usage: detach [mob | obj] {target name} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
> 
Fizban: detach room {target vnum | '.'} {trigger name/vnum | 'all'}
> 
Fizban: syntax is actually detach room {trig vnum} {room vnum}   etc


Usage: detach [mob | obj | target name/vnum] {trig vnum | 'all'}
       detach room {trig vnum | '.'} {room vnum | 'all'}

   Detach removes a trigger to one instance of a mob/obj/room, for testing or 
other purposes. The command only removes the trigger temporarily, until the
room/obj/mob is reloaded via reboot, zreset, load.

Use the optional arguments 'mob' and 'obj' to differentiate if more entities
with the same alias are in the room.

Examples:
detach room 14500 14520 - remove trigger 14500 from room 14520.
detach room all         - removes all triggers from a room.
detach Santa 1332       - detach trigger 1332 from mob 1308 (Santa).
detach mob Santa all    - detach all triggers from Santa.
detach Santa all        - Same as above.
detach sword 1300       - detach trigger 1300 from sword.
detach obj sword 1300   - You guessed it - same as above.
detach sword all        - detach all triggers from the sword.

DIG UNDIG RDIG RELINK RLINKS 

Builders working on their trial vnum do not need to learn this command, yet.   
Usage: dig <direction> <target room>
   This command creates a two-way exit from the room you're currently in to the
room specified. The direction can be any of north, east, south, west, up and 
down. If the target room does not exist it will be created. If either exit 
already exists, you will receive an error. To purge an exit use: dig <dir> -1.
Directions can be abbreviated. 

Examples: 
dig north 1202
   Will make an exit to the north from here to 1202, and an exit from 1202 south
back here.  

dig north -1
   Will remove the exit you just made.

NOTE: Dig does not autosave on exit. you must type SAVEALL. This way if you 
      mess up and want the links deleted we can just reboot and wipe them.

   All areas submitted or created on The Builder Academy remain the property
of the original builder.  By creating or submitting an area the builder gives 
the staff of TBA the right to edit, modify, and use the material as we see fit 
on TBA without any penalty, fee, whining, or obligation of any sort.  TBA staff
will not normally modify anyone's work. However, it is sometimes necessary for

DISCONNECT FLOOD OVERFLOW CUTOFF CUT-OFF ENTERING-TEXT

   This commonly happens to new builders when they try to enter too much text 
at once in the text-editor.  To prevent this simply enter a sentence or two at 
a time. Hit return then enter another sentence then repeat. The MUD prevents 
people from entering large strings of text to keep the CPU from getting bogged
down. A return is required at least every 256 characters. If this is not done 
the text will simply be cut off and lost. So enter each sentence separately and
when done type /fi to format with indent.

EATING DRINKING SIP TASTE HUNGRY HUNGER THIRSTY FOOD NIBBLE

Usage: eat <item>

If you're hungry or thirsty, these commands are for you!

  > sip fountain
  
If you taste or sip, you don't consume large portions and won't be hurt badly 
by poison. But, you also will not quench your thirst or satisfy your hunger.

Thirst and Hunger are modified by objects in units of hours. So an object with 
24 drink units will quench thirst for 24 hours. Same for food. Immortals never 
become hungry, thirsty or full.

ERRORS SYSERRS INVALID 

   There are many common errors new builders cause. To simplify things they 
have all been included in this help file along with how to correct them.

1: Errant Rooms
------------
 1: [ 1233] Rumble's Room

   The most common are exits to 0 (the void). This happens when a builder 
modifies a room exit but does not include an exit room vnum. These errant 
rooms are listed by the command 'show error' The fix is simple, remove the 
exit by purge exit in redit exit menu or by using 'dig <direction> -1'

2: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) doesn't have drink type as last keyword. (oedit-keyword)

   Another common error is caused by how shop code handles drink containers 
poorly. In order for shops to display a jug as a jug of <drink type> they 
must have the drink type as the last keyword. It is good practice to put the 
drink type as the first and last word of an objects keyword (older versions 
of CircleMUD expect it first).
i.e. a shot of whisky should have the keyword: whisky shot whisky
     a cup of slime mold juice keyword should be: juice cup slime juice

3: SYSERR: Mob #5 both Aggressive and Aggressive_to_Alignment.

   Another harmless error. If your mob is aggressive there is no need to also
make it aggressive to certain alignments since AGGR means it will attack any
player it can see. Choose to make it aggressive to an alignment or aggressive 
to all.
 
4: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #.

   A simple one. Limit spell levels to the levels available, on TBA that would 
be 1-30.

5: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has negative weight (-2147483644).
   SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) has out of range level #2147483647.

   These are really annoying. This happens when you use numbers larger than 
necessary. This will actually crash many older versions of CircleMUD. Just do
not do it. Use realistic numbers.

6: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) uses 'UNDEFINED' spell #.

   There is no spell zero. Either select a spell or put -1 for none. 

7: SYSERR: Object # (oedit-s-desc) contains (5) more than maximum (3).

   When making a drink container you will set how much it initially contains 
on creation and the max it can hold if a player were to fill it. Common sense 
tells us that you can not create a container that initially holds more than 
the max you set. To simplify the max must always be greater than or equal to 
the initial amount.

8: Char is already equipped: (medit-s-desc), (oedit-s-desc)

   This happens when someone tries to equip a mob with one or more object in
a single location. HELP ZEDIT-EQUIP for all the possible object equipping 
locations. All you have to do to fix this is pick a different equip location
that is not used. 

SYSERR: bind: adress is already in use.

   This means the port you are running the MUD on is already in use. The game
is probably already running and using that port. The default port is 4000.

EVAL EVALUATE TRIG-EVALS EVALS 

Usage: eval <variable> <expression>

* this example immediately evaluates the expression below and stores the result
* in %result%
eval result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
* this result will not change after the evaluation even if %self.hitp% changes.

   The eval command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the result of the immediate evaluation of the provided expression. There also 
exists a "set" command, with the same syntax. Set differs in that the expression
is not evaluated until the variable is accessed.

Example: @RTSTAT 49@n

EVERYTHING ANYTHING

When I help people I usually ask them what they need help with. All too often
they tell me: everything. I can not teach people everything. It is up to each
individual to learn what they can and then ask informed questions. The help
files here are extensive and are continuously being developed. Read through
all of the TBA zone starting at room 3. Inform yourself and then ask an 
informed question in which I or the other staff members will be able to help
with.

EXAMINE

Usage: examine <thing to examine>

May give you some valuable information about an item or monster.

EXAMPLE-PROPOSAL PROGRESS-REPORT REPORT-EXAMPLE EXAMPLE-REPORT 

As a builder on a mud it is important that you are accountable to someone.
To prepare you for this, and to keep the Builder Academy professional, I 
request (not mandatory) a report from every builder so I can keep track of 
everyone's progress and give help to those who are serious about learning to
build. These monthly reports are due the 1st of each month. The report will 
include at a minimum the info in the example below. A simple mudmail to
Rumble with this info is sufficient. Here is an example:

Rumble's Building Report.
Builder      : Rumble
Zone         : 13 The Builder Academy
Began        : When you started working on the zone.
Player Level : 30
Rooms        : 145 complete
Mobs         : 23
Objects      : 42
Triggers     : 129 
Theme        : Its purpose, hack & slash, quest, rescue princess, kill ogre...
Completion   : When do you expect to finish it, how is the progress going?
Notes        : Such things as zone alignment, economy, quests, special mobs and
       objs, and anything else I should know about your zone. What 
       makes it unique?

To submit a report type @RAT POSTMASTER MAIL RUMBLE@n. Do not worry about 
making it look pretty. This is only necessary after you have completed your 
trialroom and if you have your own zone. This proposal is also a good example
of the Zone Description Room required for all zones. By writing the report you
can include the same information in the zone description room.

EXITS

Usage: exits

Gives you a list of the obvious exits from your location.  Of course, the less
obvious ones won't show up here - you have to THINK in order to locate those.

See also: AUTOEXIT
#0
EXPORT

   Used by the IMP's to export a zone for other MUD's. This command replaces
the zone number with QQ's. This allows any decent text-editor to "find and
replace" the QQ's with a zone number of your choice. The zone will be saved
into a compressed file as: <zone #>_<zone name>.tgz i.e. 1_Sanctus.tgz
   Use your preferred client to unpack and then a text editor to find and
replace the QQ's with your zone number. If you want to keep the existing zone
number make sure to say so when you ask for an export. The easiest way to add
a new zone is to first create the new zone and then overwrite the created 
files. A zone consist of up to 6 different files that are located in their own
directories in lib/world/: <zone_#>.mob .obj .shp .trg .qst .wld .zon

false expression. The following list are the recognized operators. They are
listed in order of priority higher. Expressions are evaluated from left to

EXTRA-DESCRIPTIONS EXTRA-DESCS E-DESCRIPTIONS REDIT-E-DESCRIPTIONS REDIT-MENU-E-DESCRIPTIONS REDIT-EXTRA-DESCRIPTIONS 
 
B) Extra descriptions menu
   Extra descriptions are used to make a room/obj more interesting, and make them
more interactive. Extra descriptions are accessed by players when they type
"look <<thing>>," where <thing> is any word you choose.  For example, you might
write a room description, which includes the tantalizing sentence, "The wall
looks strange here." Using extra descriptions, players could then see
additional detail by typing "look wall."  Choosing this option will bring you 
to the extra descriptions menu: 

1) Keyword: @y<NONE>@n
   List the words you want people to use to interact with it. Simply the 
<thing>. Do not use a/an/the/look/read in this field.

2) Description:
@y<NONE>@n
   This is the text editor for describing something in the room. Be sure to
use /fi by typing it into the last line and hitting enter.

3) Goto next description: <NOT SET>
   This option will allow you to make as many extra descriptions as you want.

   To delete an extra description all you have to do is clear the description 
with the "/c" then "/s" and quit.

#31
EXTRACT

Usage: extract <variable> <word #> <string>

   Extract can be used to save individual words in a string separately. For
example a player saying: "Do you want chicken"

extract word1 1 %speech%
extract word2 2 %speech%
extract word3 3 %speech%
extract word4 4 %speech%
say %word4% %word3% %word2% %word1%?

Would say (Yoda-esque) "chicken want you do?"

   A VNUM, or Virtual Number, is just a way to keep track of the items in the
game.  
 
3. I'm building an area, but I don't want to be redundant with words.
   Invest in a thesaurus. Makes a world of difference, and if that doesn't 
help, just make up your own words for things you create (just be sure to 
describe them very well. Use @Chttp://m-w.com/@n for an online thesaurus
and dictionary. You can @Rtell m-w <word>@n to lookup a definition.

4. Where can I learn Trigedit?
   Here! Welcor is now the developer of trigedit. We have extensive help files,
examples and tutorials. @RHELP TRIGEDIT@n and check out all the related help

FIZBAN

Unlike Rumble, Fizban actually doesn't want your help. He is already well
on his way to world domination. Sometimes he pretends to lack powers he
mastered long ago so to seem feeble, but in actuality he is one of the
most powerful beings in existence and seeks to destroy the world. He only
pretends to be the Avatar of Paladine because then no one suspects him.
The Avatar of Fizban that is here on The Builder Academy is one of his
feeble essences, where he pretends to not be overly competent and actually
humble and helpful, but whatever you do...don't be fooled! It should be obvious
from the fact he's built 4 rooms in that many years that he is spending most
of his time elsewhere...on much darker motives than building happy zones
for tbaMUD players.

   The above values for drunkenness/fullness/thirst are in the units of one
hour of effect per four units of liquid drunk.  For example, imagine that
Dragon drinks an entire bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.  According to the
table above, saltwater has a drunkenness value of 0, fullness value of 1 and
thirst value of -2.  Therefore:
His drunkenness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making him more thirsty.
A player's drunkenness, fullness, and thirst can range from 0 to 24.
24 is the maximum; 0 means the person is completely sober, hungry,
or thirsty respectively.

FREEZE THAW FREEZING FROZEN

Usage: freeze [target]
       thaw [target]

   FREEZE is used to prevent a player from playing.  If frozen, the game will 
ignore all commands entered by the player, including QUIT, until the player is 
unfrozen with THAW. Obviously, this command should only be used in extreme 
disciplinary circumstances.

GET TAKE-ALL-CORPSE LOOT

"Get" and "take" are exactly the same and can be used interchangeably.

Usage: get | take <object>
       get | take all [object]
       get | take all all.<object>
       get | take all.<object> all.<object>

If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to pick
it up.  'get' can also be used to extract items from containers.

Examples:

  > get sword corpse
  > take all corpse
  > get all all.bag
  > take all.bread all.bag
  > get all 2.corpse (to retrieve items from the second corpse in a room)

GLOBALS GLOBAL-VARIABLES GLOBAL-VARS GVARS TRIGEDIT-GLOBALS TRIG-GLOBALS

Usage: global <variablename> 

   Global variables allow a room/mob/obj trigger variable to be used by another
trigger on the same room/mob/obj. i.e. a bribe trigger could global that the mob
has_been_bribed then when a player tries to leave the mobs leave trigger would
check the global variable to allow or prevent passage accordingly.

* To make a variable 'reachable' from other triggers it has to be made 'global'. 
* In this case I make a local known var %has_bribed_guard% and make it global. 
* It is a good idea to use this in conjunction with context.
set has_bribed_guard 1
global has_bribed_guard

Globals can be checked by varexists: if %actor.varexists(<variable>)%

Global variables should not be used when you want to remember something about a 
player. To save something to a players file for future use always use REMOTE.

GOTO TRANSFER TRANSPORT TELEPORT

Usage: goto <location>
       trans [target]
       teleport [target] <location>
   These commands are used to transports yourself and others to different 
rooms. GOTO allows you to go to other rooms; TRANS transports a person from 
wherever they are to the room YOU are in; TELEPORT transports your victim to 
some other location. For both GOTO and TELEPORT, the location specified can 
be either a virtual room number or the name of a character or object.

Examples:
  > goto 3001
  > goto Rumble
  > trans fido
  > teleport fido 3001
  > teleport fido 2.fido

GRAMMAR GRAMMER TIPS 

   Love thy dictionary. Be sure to check the spelling of your work. Medieval 
words can be particularly tricky and elude electronic spell checkers. A good 
dictionary, however, will help you spell archaic words. Whenever I am building 
I use our Merriam Webster dictionary link on TBA to check any tough words for
proper spelling. Test it out @RTELL M-W DEFINITION@n. We hope to add a thesaurus
soon! Goto @Chttp://m-w.com/@n until then.
  I have found that a good principle to make is to avoid the use of all 
contractions. For example, if you mean to say "it is", do not use "it's", spell
it out. This will help differentiate between "its" (which means 'belonging to 
it') and "it is". Another set of problem words to take note of is the 
"they're", "there", and "their". The first can be avoided because it is a 
contraction, the second is not here, but there, and the final one means that 
it belongs to them. One final instance to take note of are "to", "too", and 
"two". The first is used when you want to say something like 'the passage 
leads to there', the second should be used in situations where there is an
excess of something, such as 'too much red paint was used to cover the walls 
there'. The final one is the number 2 (two).
   As far as obscenity in descriptions is concerned, we have no problem with 
using it in humor or description. If your description involves the use of 
some slang or 'bad' words, no biggie. Just don't abuse the use of any words.
We don't want the MUD filthy, just fun!

GREP

grep is a shell command. Only imps/gods with shell access can use it from the 
command prompt.
Stands for 'global regular expression print' searches for strings in text files.
Examples:
grep -r 'some_function()' *.c     Searches all files with the wildcard match *.c
                                  (@Wr@necursively through higher directory 
                                  branches) for the term some_function(). This 
                                  would be a case sensitive search.
grep -in 'foo_bar' *.h            Searches all files with the wildcard match *.h
                                  in the current directory. @Wi@n is a case 
                                  insensitive search, while @Wn@n will return 
                                  results preceded with the line number on which
                                  they occur.
grep -c 'bar_foo' *               Would search all files in the current
                                  directory for the term bar_foo and return a
                                  count of the number of times it occurs.
In some cases grep switches can be appended to each other, -rin would be a good
example of combining the first two examples. For more detailed information (from
the shell prompt), type @Wman grep@n.
#31
GROUP

Usage: group 
       group < list | new | join | leave | options | kick >

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP list will show
you a listing of all groups within the game, as well as their zone location and
whether or not they are seeking new members.
If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group.  Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow.  Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.
To join a group, you must target a member of an "open" group (as in accepting
new members) and use GROUP join <player name>.

Example:
  Rumble wishes to join Vatiken's group, so assuming Vatiken has set his group
  to open. Rumble then types:
  > group join Vatiken 

To make a group, the wannabe "leader" will use the GROUP new command:
  > group new
  
To leave a group, simple use GROUP leave:
  > group leave
  
If the leader leaves the group and one or more members still exists, a new
leader will be chosen at random, otherwise the group will be disbanded.
Group Leaders:

To edit the options in a group, use the GROUP option <option> commands.
  > group option anonymous     : Group information will be hidden/revealed
  > group option open          : Group will be open/closed to new members

To kick someone from the group, use GROUP kick <player name>
  > group kick rumble

they will be set. Currently we do not use houses here.

Usage: hcontrol build <house vnum> <exit dir> <player name>
       hcontrol destroy <house vnum>
       hcontrol pay <house vnum>
       hcontrol show

   House control, controls the addition, removal, and payments of houses.

HOUSE

The HOUSE command is used to add or remove guests from your house's guest
list.  You must be standing in your house to use this command.  Only the
primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them
from the guest list.

See also: HOUSES
#0
HOUSES

A house entails two things:
Access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will be allowed
to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five minutes.  You
can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing in your house.
In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the last crash-save
will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  Also, if you own
a house, and quit from the game while standing in your house, you will be
loaded into your house next time you enter the game.

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

Houses are an alternative to renting.  You can simply enter your house and
quit; your objects will drop to the ground and be crash-saved for when you
return.  There is currently no limit to the number of objects which can be
stored in your house.  Of course, players must expect to pay a much higher
premium for the convenience of houses; contact your local Implementor for
a fee schedule.

   if %actor.is_pc%
     %echo% You are a player
   else 
     %echo% You are a mob.

   An 'if' must occur before the other three. If expression evaluates to true 
(@RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n), the statements between the if statement and the next 
elseif, else, or end are executed. If it stopped at an elseif or else, it scans 
for the next end, and continues execution at that point. If the expression 
evaluated to false, it searches for the next elseif, else, or end. If it finds 
an elseif, it checks that expression. If it is true, it executes the statements 
between the elseif and the next elseif, else, or end, and then finds the end of
the block. If it is false, it continues searching in the same pattern, until a 
true elseif is found, an else is found, or an end is found. There may be 0 or 
1 else statements and 0 or many elseif statements in the block.

For anyone having trouble with the format of if/elseif/else/end blocks
Examples: @RTSTAT 22, 93@n

***EVERY IF NEEDS AN END: 2 IF'S NEEDS 2 ENDS....***

JUNK

Usage: junk <object>
       junk <number> coins

Use JUNK instead of DROP if you want to keep the world a little cleaner.  If
you JUNK something, it will disappear and you'll get a few coins or experience
points, just as if you had dropped it in the dump.

Examples:

  > junk cup
  > junk all.bronze
  > junk 500 coins

KEY-BASICS KEYS-BASICS OEDIT-KEYS

If you want to make a room accessible only by a key you must first make an 
object of type key and then place that objects vnum in the exit menu. To
prevent a thief from picking the lock you must also set the PICKPROOF flag.

Always create a unique name and description for your key and give hints in the 
description about where it should be used.

A good practice is to ensure keys load more than one instance since key storage
in a house is no different from a character always idling with keys to hoard 
them. Single instance keys are a bad idea since if a player dies behind a door 
with the only key in their corpse they have no way to get back. Also, keys 
should always be the first dependent object loaded to a mob so they don't rely
on other equipment loading to the mob prior to it.

See also: KEYS, ZONE-DESC, REDIT-EXIT
#31
KEYS DOORS GATES

Usage: unlock [door]

If you find a locked door use a key to open it. You must have the correct key 
in your inventory to unlock a door.

See also: OPEN

#0
KEYWORDS

   Keywords are what the player will use to interact with the mobs and objects.
Such as "look Rusty" and "wield bludger" If you have more than one keyword 
separate them with spaces, not commas. They should never include colorcodes or 
the words "look, look at, a, an, the, of, some, etc." Only use keywords a 
player can figure out by the s-desc, l-desc, d-desc, or extra descriptions. 
Always make them unique, there are already plenty of swords and citizens on 
most MUDs. 

See also: OEDIT-KEYWORD, MEDIT-KEYWORDS, EXTRA, COLORCODES
#31
KICK

Some fighting classes only.

Usage: kick [target]

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned.  The higher
level you reach the harder you kick.  There is one small catch -- whenever
you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three 
rounds of 'Violence' -- so be sure that you do not need to flee!

See also: BASH, RESCUE
#0
KILL HIT FIGHT ATTACK SLAY BATTLES SMITE STRIKE CHOP VIOLENCE

Usage: kill [target]
       hit [target]

A good way to start a fight.  Not a good idea to hit other players.

If you are an immortal there is no point in killing anything. You can simply
purge them. Since you start with no equipment or weapon you will not be able 
to inflict much damage. Learn to use the SET command to change your stats. You
can take damage and die.
 
See also: FLEE, WIMPY
#0
KILLERS PLAYERKILLING PLAYERKILLERS PKILLERS PKILLING

   The act of slaughtering another player. Not a nice thing to do. If you do
such a horrible and pointless thing you will need to be pardoned by the staff.

LAG

   Thanks for the help, but sometimes lag just can not be prevented. We are 
based on a stable server so more than likely the lag is coming from the route 
between your computer and our server. Use http://www.pingtest.net/ to test
your connection.

#0
LANCE

   When building, there are some things that separate a great builder from a
weak builder.  Items such as not using "you" in any descriptions, using 
Capitals in title (except for prepositions). For example, "Dracula's Room of
Horrors" instead of "dracula's room of horrors." Some other common problems are:
Not putting in Room Extra Descriptions (Command B) and not using /fi to format 
and indent after descriptions (in any of the edits and also in messages). To 
know the commands while writing a description, type /h. It will tell you what
all the / commands do).

#31
LAST LASTLISTS

Usage: last [player_name | all] [#]
 
For checking the last time(s) a person logged on, their sitename, and their
ID number. This now works similar to the unix version of 'last'. This will
display where the player connected from, how long they connected, and how
they disconnected.
 
   last without arguments displays the last 10 entries.
   last with a name only displays the 'stock' last entry.
   last with a number displays that many entries (combines with name)
 
  
Examples: 
 
> last Rumble
[    2] [34 Wa] Rumble       : localhost : Tue Sep  9 06:13:52 2003
 
> last 4 Rumble
Last log

Usage: leave

If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the nearest
obvious exit to the outside.

#0
LEVELS ATTAINING-LEVELS LEVEL-REQUIREMENTS
@n
Usage: @ylevels [<min>-<max> | <range>]@n
@n
The levels command displays the experience points required to attain all levels
in the game.  When followed by a number, it shows the required experience for
the specified number of levels either side of your current level.  You can also
specify a level range.
@n
Examples:
@clevels       @n- shows all levels (1-30)
@clevels 5     @n- shows 5 levels either side of your current level
@clevels 10-20 @n- shows level 10 to level 20

LICENSES

The CircleMUD License
CircleMUD was created by:


Jeremy Elson
Department of Computer Science
Johns Hopkins University
Baltimore, MD 21218 USA

CircleMUD is licensed software. This file contains the text of the CircleMUD 
license. If you wish to use the CircleMUD system in any way, or use any of its 
source code, you must read this license and are legally bound to comply with it. 

CircleMUD is a derivative work based on the DikuMUD system written by Hans 
Henrik Staerfeldt, Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian 
Hammer. DikuMUD is also licensed software; you are legally bound to comply with
the original DikuMUD license as well as the CircleMUD license if you wish to 
use CircleMUD. 

Use of the CircleMUD code in any capacity implies that you have read, 
understood, and agreed to abide by the terms and conditions set down by this 
license and the DikuMUD license. If you use CircleMUD without complying with 
the license, you are breaking the law. 

Using CircleMUD legally is easy. In short, the license requires three things: 

You must not use CircleMUD to make money or be compensated in any way. 
You must give the authors credit for their work. 
You must comply with the DikuMUD license. 
That's it -- those are the main conditions set down by this license. 
Unfortunately, past experience has shown that many people are not willing to 
follow the spirit of the license, so the remainder of this document will 
clearly define those conditions in an attempt to prevent people from 
circumventing them. 

The first condition says that you must not use CircleMUD to make money in any 
way or be otherwise compensated. CircleMUD was developed in people's 
uncompensated spare time and was given to you free of charge, and you must not 
use it to make money. CircleMUD must not in any way be used to facilitate your 
acceptance of fees, donations, or other compensation. Examples include, but are
not limited to the following: 

If you run CircleMUD, you must not require any type of fee or donation in 
exchange for being able to play CircleMUD. You must not solicit, offer or 
accept any kind of donation from your players in exchange for enhanced status 
in the game such as increased levels, character stats, gold, or equipment. 

You must not solicit or accept money or other donations in exchange for running
CircleMUD. You must not accept money or other donations from your players for 
purposes such as hardware upgrades for running CircleMUD. 

You must not sell CircleMUD. You must not accept any type of fee in exchange 
for distributing or copying CircleMUD. 

If you are a CircleMUD administrator, You must not accept any type of 
reimbursement for money spent out of pocket for running CircleMUD, i.e., for 
equipment expenses or fees incurred from service providers. 

The second part of the license states that you must give credit to the creators
of CircleMUD. A great deal of work went into the creation of CircleMUD, and it 
was given to you completely free of charge; claiming that you wrote the MUD 
yourself is a slap in the face to everyone who worked to bring you a high 
quality product while asking for nothing but credit for their work in return. 
Specifically, the following are required: 

The text in the 'credits' file distributed with CircleMUD must be preserved. 
You may add your own credits to the file, but the existing text must not be 
removed, abridged, truncated, or changed in any way. This file must be 
displayed when the 'credits' command is used from within the MUD. 

The "CIRCLEMUD" help entry must be maintained intact and unchanged, and 
displayed in its entirety when the 'help circlemud' command is used. 

The login sequence must contain the names of the DikuMUD and CircleMUD 
creators. The 'login sequence' is defined as the text seen by players between 
the time they connect to the MUD and when they start to play the game itself. 

This license must be distributed AS IS with all copies or portions of the 
CircleMUD that you distribute, if any, including works derived from CircleMUD. 

You must not remove, change, or modify any notices of copyright, licensing or 
authorship found in any CircleMUD source code files. 

Claims that any of the above requirements are inapplicable to a particular MUD 
for reasons such as "our MUD is totally rewritten" or similar are completely 
invalid. If you can write a MUD completely from scratch then you are encouraged
to do so by all means, but use of any part of the CircleMUD or DikuMUD source 
code requires that their respective licenses be followed, including the 
crediting requirements. 

The third part of the license simply states that you must comply with the 
DikuMUD license. This is required because CircleMUD is a DikuMUD derivative. 
The DikuMUD license is included below. 
You are allowed to use, modify and redistribute all CircleMUD source code and
documentation as long as such use does not violate any of the rules set down by
this license.

This document contains the rules by which you can use, alter or publish
parts of DikuMud. DikuMud has been created by the above five listed persons
in their spare time, at DIKU (Computer Science Institute at Copenhagen
University). You are legally bound to follow the rules described in this
document.

Rules:

   !! DikuMud is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!

   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of DikuMud in
   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for
   distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge
   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.
   By breaking these rules you violate the agreement between us and the
   University, and hence will be sued.

   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or
   sources given to you.

   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give
   away any part of DikuMud (which is to be done as described in this
   document).

   If you publish *any* part of dikumud, we as creators must appear in the
   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this
   license. Before publishing you must first send us a message, by
   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us what, where and when you are
   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)

   If you wish to setup a version of DikuMud on any computer system, you
   must send us a message , by snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us where
   and when you are running the game. (remember to include 
   your address, name etc.)

   Any running version of DikuMud must include our names in the login
   sequence. Furthermore the "credits" command shall always contain
   our name, addresses, and a notice which states we have created DikuMud.

   You are allowed to alter DikuMud, source and documentation as long as
   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.

Regards,

The DikuMud Group

Note:
We hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports
on bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that we are all using our spare
time to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their
time. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project.
If you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to
hear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive
new updates and improvements made to the game.

MOBILE STANDARDS: See @RMEDIT STANDARDS@n

   Never use outrageously large numbers. This will crash stock OLC. There are
limits on TBA to prevent crashes. But, it is just a waste of time to set large
numbers or applies that unbalance the game. You will be made to fix them if you 
want your zone used or approved.
   Zcheck (Immortal and above) checks a zone for these and other standards.

#31
LINK LINKDEATHS

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

See Also: LINKS
#0
LINKLESS

   The state a character becomes when they lose their connection. 

People may go linkless for many reasons:
  Their net connection might cut them off suddenly.
  Their computer might think its time for a random reset.
  They might not log off correctly.

#0
LINKS

Usage : links <zone number>

   Lists all links from the given zone to any other zones.

See also: RESOURCES, LINK
#31
LIST

Usage:  list [item type]

If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the
list.  The list contains all of the items currently for sale and in
what quantity.  The price for each item is also listed.  If you are
interested in a particular type of item, you can specify which items to
list.
 
Examples:
 
  > list             (list all items for sale)
  > list sword       (list all swords for sale)

LITTERING

Do not load mobiles or objects in other people's zones. Especially in TBA zone
and immortal rooms.

#31
LOADING MOBLOAD OBJLOAD MOB-LOADING OBJECT-LOADING LOAD-MOBILE LOAD-OBJECT OBJ-LOAD 

Load only temporarily loads the mob/obj. It should NOT be used except for testing
purposes. Use zedit to load a mob/obj to your zone.
 
Usage: load <mob | obj> <virtual number>

   LOAD is used to create mobiles and objects.  The first argument specifies if
you are trying to load a mobile or an object; the second is the virtual number.
LOAD has been modified on TBA. Immortals can not load mobs outside of their zone.
 
Example:
  > load obj 3099
  You create a bulletin board.
  > load mob 3005
  You create the receptionist.

See also: VNUM, PURGE, %LOAD%, ZEDIT-NEW, ZRESET
#31
LOADROOM

An entry in the player file that can be set to load players to a specific
room when they enter the game.  

See Also: SET
#31
LOCATE-OBJECT

Usage       : cast 'locate object' <object>
Accumulative: -
Duration    : Instantaneous
Level       : Mage level 6.

If possible you will know exactly where an object is, or the name of the person 
using it.  If more than one object by the same name exists, you will get a 
listing of several objects. The maximum number of objects you can 
simultaneously locate is your level divided by 2.
#0
LOCATIONS

   It is very important to know where an area is going to fit in with the world
before it is written. This may seem very obvious, but it is a painful truth
that many people make areas without regard for where they will be placed on the
MUD. A character should not be walking around in an idyllic happy forest and
suddenly come upon an arctic wilderness.  Likewise a character should not
venture a couple steps outside a main human city and find themselves in an
ancient elven homeland. Plan where your new area is going to go and make sure 
it does not grievously conflict with surrounding terrain, climate, politics, 
mythology, and races. 
   The best thing to do, of course, is to integrate your zone seamlessly with
the rest of the world rather than allowing for one connecting point and sealing
the zone off from its surroundings in all other directions. It is not easy to
do this, and it is not always even possible. But it is worth spending some time
working on the rooms that link the zone as you first conceived it.
   If it is a city, the main gates probably are going to open out onto an
existing road, not into the middle of a forest.  Give some thought to using a
few rooms to link the "main" part of your area to a spot that is already in the
MUD (be creative - as well as roads and pathways, there are waterways and other
means to reach places). If it is more of a wilderness-type area, then the way
it links might be a bit more vague, and it might link in more than one place - 
when was the last time you saw a forest, field, or desert that could only be 
reached in one way? As important as where the zone should begin is where it 
should end. A city or even a village might have walls and a logical "edge," 
but if you are working with wilderness or even just the surroundings beyond 
the city itself, it is hard to know where and how to draw the boundaries.
Natural formations seem like the perfect answer -- rivers, mountains, and so
on -- BUT (and I think this is a huge but) the problem with these is that they
are extremely prominent geographical features and are not a good "throwaway"
solution.  
   If you are writing forest room upon forest room and think you will never get
to the end, do not just write in an insurmountable mountain range or a 
gratuitous river.  That will lead to questions like, "What is on the other 
side of the mountains, and why can not I approach them or even see them from
anywhere else?" or "Why did this river suddenly come to an abrupt end as soon 
as I left this forest?" Far better is to do something on a smaller scale -- the
trees just get too dense to move on... do not assume that your area has only 
one or two points of entry. Try and make your area accessible from at least 
two different points, preferably in different directions. Try and leave at 
least one possible exit on each "side" of your area in case something needs 
to be linked to it later. 
   TBA allows builders to create whatever their hearts desire and we have no 
MUDwide theme. Because of this your zone will be isolated from all others and 
should be designed to be added easily into any MUD. For location you should
plan the geographic environment: Forest, tundra, city, port, etc.

MAKEUID UID UNIQUE

Usage: makeuid variable id

* We have one mob giving a quest. This mob sets the targets id as a global on 
* the player via the 'remote' command, like this:
eval quest_object %obj.id%
remote quest_object %actor.id%
* We then have another mob receiving the quest object, with the following trigger.
if !(%actor.varexists(quest_object)%)
  return 0
  halt
end
* now we know the player has a quest_object variable
makeuid obj %actor.quest_object%
say Have you brought me %obj.shortdesc%, %actor.name% ?
say You must bring it to me to complete your quest, you know.

   Creates a new variable with the name given, whose contents shall be suitable 
for referring to a character, object, or room whose id is provided.

MAXLOADED MAX-LOADED ZEDIT-MAXLOADED ZEDIT-MISTAKES 

   A mistake most new builders make is the misunderstanding of "Max allowed"
on the mud. What it means by max allowed is simply if this many exists on the 
mud, do not load anymore. So if you want 1 shopkeeper. Set it to one. If you 
want 10 Kobolds set it to 10. The same goes for objects. In both cases never
put a max of over 99. This is just a good practice and prevents 1000's of the
same mobs or objects making a MUD look generic.
   Actual mob loading gets a little trickier. Because if you set it to 10 
Kobolds in one room, then every time that zone resets another Kobold will be 
loaded until you have 10 within that one room. So you need to disperse them. 
You can do this by setting 5 different load mob commands in 5 different rooms.
All with a max load of 10. The first time the zone resets. 5 Kobolds will be 
loaded in 5 different rooms. The second time another 5 Kobolds will be loaded 
into those same rooms. So now you would have 5 rooms with 2 Kobolds in each. 
Next zone reset - nothing changes unless some players come along and kills some
Kobolds.  An object in a players rent file does not count as in the game.

MEDIT-EXPERIENCE MEDIT-XP MEDIT-ALIGNMENT

(B) Exp Points:  [    115600]  (E) Alignment: [ 1000]

Alignment
A number from -1000 to 1000 representing the mobs initial alignment.
 
Evil     -1000  to  -350 
Neutral  -349   to   349 
Good      350   to  1000
 
The alignment of a mobile is determined entirely by you, depending on
the type of area you are creating. The alignment can be from -1000 
(extremely evil) to +1000 (divinely good).

   Experience is simply the number of experience points the mobile is born 
with. This is not the exact number of experience points the player will get
for killing the mob. A fraction of this experience is given for damaging and 
killing a mob. This is limited by a max experience gain value and will also be
split between members if grouped. Use the autoroll option if you are unsure of
what to put here.

MEDIT-GOLD

(C) Gold:        [       #]

   Gold is the number of coins the mobile is born with. Do not give gold to 
animals or anything unlikely to need money. For example a pigeon should not 
be carrying 100 gold. Well, maybe it is a carrier pigeon, ;-) be reasonable.
There are other ways to reward players than with gold or experience. Try
objects and quests.

MEDIT-HITROLL MEDIT-DAMROLL MEDIT-NUMDAMDICE MEDIT-SIZEDAMDICE MEDIT-BHD

(8) DamRoll:      [    5]
   Damroll determines how much damage a mob does per hit when fighting.
   
(D) Hitroll:   [   11]
   Hitroll determines how often a mob lands a direct hit when fighting.
 
Bare Hand Damage (xdy+z): 
(6) BHD NumDice:  [    5]
(7) BHD SizeDice: [    5]
   For BHD (bare hand damage), xdy specifies the dice rolls and z is the 
strength bonus added both to BHD and weapon-inflicted damage. For example,
a monster with a BHD of 1d4+10 will do between 11 and 14 hit points each 
round without a weapon. If the monster picks up and wields a tiny stick 
which gives 1d2 damage, then the monster will do 1d2 + 10 points of damage 
per round with the stick.

MEDIT-KEYWORDS MEDIT-ALIAS MEDIT-SEX MEDITNAME MOB-NAME MEDIT-ALIAS MOB-SEX 

1) Sex: @yneutral@n 
   This is pretty self-explanatory. Male, Female, or Neutral. Remember if the
mob is too small to determine its sex you should set it as neutral.  

2) Keywords: @ymob unfinished@n
   A keyword is the word you use to act on a mob. For example the keyword: "Spike 
dog black angry" would allow the following commands to work: kill Spike, look 
black, consider angry, poke dog, etc. So many people get this wrong I will 
rephrase it. It is a list of KEYWORDS which players can use to interact 
with the mobile.  @RHELP KEYWORDS@n. 

Examples: "sparkly golden dragon" "bassett hound fat"

#31
MEDIT-L-DESCRIPTION LDESCRIPTION L-DESCRIPTION LONG-DESCRIPTION
 
4) L-Desc:-
@yAn unfinished mob stands here.@n
   This is what you see when you look at the room with the mob in it.
Unlike the Short Description, the long description must end with proper 
punctuation, and be a complete sentence with proper grammar. Remember that 
the long description will follow the room description. For the description, 
try to tell the player what the mobile looks like, how it is acting, etc... 
Do not include items in the mobs description.
   If there is an aggressive mob in the room, do not put something to the effect
of "The Draconian King rises from his throne as you enter and strikes!" either
in the room description or the mobs long description. If the mob is really
that aggressive, the player will not have time to see it. Also, if the player is
somehow protected or invisible the mob will not attack, it will look pretty 
silly.

MEDIT-LEVEL MOB-STANDARDS MOB-LIMITS AUTOROLL AUTOGENERATE GENERATE MEDIT-STANDARDS MOB-BALANCE

(1) Level:       [  #]
(2) Auto Set Stats (based on level)

   The level of the monster, from 1 to 30. Instead of having to manually
enter all the data below, you can simply enter the level and then select option
2 to autoroll all other fields so they will be calculated for you. This is a 
guideline for builders, not a set standard. Feel free to modify any of these 
values. Keep it reasonable. The level of the mob is used in the consider 
command, and when gaining experience. 

Here is our autoroll standard, entering mob level will calculate the following:
      GET_LEVEL(OLC_MOB(d))   = LIMIT(i, 1, 30);
      GET_BONUS(OLC_MOB(d))   = mob_lev*10;          /* hit point bonus         */
      GET_HIT(OLC_MOB(d))     = mob_lev/5;           /* number of hitpoint dice */
      GET_MANA(OLC_MOB(d))    = mob_lev/5;           /* size of hitpoint dice   */
      GET_HITROLL(OLC_MOB(d)) = mob_lev/3;           /* hitroll 0-10            */
      GET_DAMROLL(OLC_MOB(d)) = mob_lev/6;           /* damroll 0-5             */
      GET_AC(OLC_MOB(d))      = (100-(mob_lev*6));   /* AC 94 to -80            */
      GET_NDD(OLC_MOB(d))     = MAX(1, mob_lev/6);   /* number damage dice 1-5  */
      GET_SDD(OLC_MOB(d))     = MAX(2, mob_lev/6);   /* size of damage dice 2-5 */
      GET_EXP(OLC_MOB(d))     = (mob_lev*mob_lev*100);
      GET_GOLD(OLC_MOB(d))    = (mob_lev*10);

0) SPEC        This flag must be set on mobiles which have special procedures
               written in C.  In addition to setting this bit, the specproc

               be written. Instead of using this use scripts. DO NOT SET.
1) SENTINEL    Mob will not leave the room.
2) SCAVENGER   The mob should pick up valuables it finds on the ground.  More

3) ISNPC       Default is on, do not change. @RHELP ISNPC@n.
4) AWARE       Set for mobs which cannot be backstabbed.
5) AGGR        Mob will hit all players in the room it can see. See also the

6) STAY_ZONE   Mob will not leave its zone. All mobs should have this flag or

7) WIMPY       Mob will flee when being attacked if it has less than 20% of
               its hit points.  If the WIMPY bit is set in conjunction with
               any of the forms of the AGGRESSIVE bit, the mob will only

8) AGGR_EVIL   Mob will attack players that are evil-aligned.
9) AGGR_GOOD   Mob will attack players that are good-aligned.

12) HELPER     The mob will attack any player it sees in the room that is
               fighting with a mobile in the room. Useful for groups of
               mobiles that travel together; i.e. three snakes in a pit, to
               force players to fight all three simultaneously instead of
               picking off one at a time.
13) NOCHARM    Mob cannot be charmed.

MEDIT-NUM-HP-DICE MEDIT-SIZE-HP-DICE MEDIT-HP-BONUS HPBONUS NUM-HP-DICE NUMHPDICE HP-DICE

Hit Points  (xdy+z):
(3) HP NumDice:  [    #]
(4) HP SizeDice: [    #]
(5) HP Addition: [    #]
(range # to #)      

   Hit Points are calculated by rolling dice. The first value determines
the number of die, the second the size of the die. This may be confusing 
for some so to make this easier I would suggest to always set the HP 
Bonus: to how many hit points you want the mob to have instead of having 
to figure out the rolls of the dice etc. Or better yet, just enter the mob
level and let the autoroll settings calculate it for you.

MEDIT-NUMBER

-- Mob Number:  
   This is the VNUM of the mob you are editing. This number is critical, it 
is the identity of the mobile within the game. It is the number that will
be used to reference the mobile from zone files and is the number used to
load mobiles from within the game. 

   Remember, not all mobs have to be designed to be killed, develop them into 
the plot instead. In this way, an area can be made infinitely more exciting by 
having something to do besides killing. Make some quests with triggers. Have
mobs interact with the players, respond to questions, etc.
   Try to keep mobs realistic. If a mob is not humanoid they probably do not have
money, and do not go around wearing all that much by the way of clothing. 
Instead of gold reward the player with a pelt, teeth, claws, etc. Always have
a mob carry *something*. It might be low-grade piece of food, trash, or a bad
rash. Be creative.

#31
MEDIT-POSITIONS MEDIT-DEFAULT MOB-POSITIONS MOBILE-POSITIONS

I) Position  : @yStanding@n
J) Default   : @yStanding@n
   Position is the state of the mobile when it is first loaded, which should 
be one of the following numbers:
 
 0) Dead             - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 1) Mortally wounded - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 2) Incapacitated    - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 3) Stunned          - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 4) Sleeping         - The monster is sleeping.
 5) Resting          - The monster is resting.
 6) Sitting          - The monster is sitting.
 7) Fighting         - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
 8) Standing         - The monster is standing (DEFAULT).
 
   Default position is the position to which monsters will return after a 
fight, which should be one of the same numbers as given above for Load 
Position. In addition, the Default Position defines when the mobs long 
description is displayed. For example if a mob is sleeping it will not show 
the l-desc, instead it will display "<<s-desc>> is <<position>>."
   Angry mobs can be simulated by loading them sitting and aggressive,
with a default position of standing.  After being attacked, they will
wander around instead of sitting back down!  Other interesting things
can be done with the position values as well...
#31
MEDIT-S-DESC S-DESC SDESC MOB-S-DESC SHORT-DESCRIPTION

3) S-Desc: @ythe unfinished mob@n
   The description of the mobile used by the MUD when the mobile takes some
action.  For example, a short description of "the building assistant" would
result in messages such as "The building assistant leaves south." and "The
building assistant hits you hard." The Short Description should never end
with a punctuation mark or be capitalized because it will be inserted into 
the middle of sentences such as those above. For short descriptions, always 
use "the" or "a" unless the mobile has a proper name. Give your mobs 
interesting names and occupations. 
   Be inventive with mobs. Most mobs have a boring short description. For 
example, "a dragon" or "a goblin". While "a fierce fire breathing dragon" 
or "an obese yellow goblin" are far more impressive. Name your mobs, or at 
least give them an occupation. Seeing the generic 'a citizen' gets boring. 
As a player, which would you like to say that you killed: 'a citizen' or 
'The Great Speaker of the Land'? Both could easily be the same mob, but 
one sounds more impressive than the other.

NUMDICE DAMDICE NUM-DICE DAM-DICE NUMDAMDICE DICE DAMAGE-DICE HITPOINTS MODIFIERS WEAPONS-DAMAGE WEAPON-DAMAGE HP-DICE HP-BONUS DMG

   Different weapons, mobs, spells, and traps cause different damage. 2D5
means the damage will be calculated by rolling a 5 sided die twice. This is
leftover from such games as D&D. Where a questmaster determined damage by
rolling a die. <times to roll>d<size of die>.
   3d5 means a five sided die will be rolled 3 times. This could give a range
of results from 3 to 15. An alternate and easier to understand method would be
to think of the worse and best case scenarios. Example: 5d8. The first number is
always the minimum damage: 5. Because worse case scenario would be rolling ones
every time. The best case scenario, or max damage, is simply 5 times 8. Meaning
you roll eights every time: 40. So 5d8 gives 5-40 damage. 6d7 means 6-42. 4d5
is 4-20 points damage.
   The question often comes up as to what damage a weapon should inflict. I 
will attempt to explain. To understand damage you first need to know hitpoints.
A player starts with 10 hitpoints. Then they gain a certain amount depending on
their class when they level. Stock tbaMUD uses the following: Magic Users
gain 3-8, Clerics 5-10, Thieves 7-13, Warriors 10-15. So a level 1 Warrior
will have 20-25 hitpoints. Now, let us apply common sense. A weapon that does
25 points of damage could kill a level 1 player in one hit. While a weapon with
a damage of 1-2 points (1d2) would allow for several rounds of combat and a 
chance to flee. A level 30 warrior would have 310-460 hitpoints. So a weapon
with damage of 50 would be okay. That is why we suggest 50 as max weapon damage.
To keep things simple I would suggest weapons only do damage equal or double to
the players level.  

   Average damage is calculated by this formula: ((DAMDICE + 1)/2) X NUMDICE
4d5 = ((5+1)/2) X 4 = 3 X 4 = 12 points average damage. Which makes sense 
since 4d5 would give damage between 4-20.

NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS NUMARG NARG TRIGEDIT-NUMERIC-ARGUMENTS %NUMERIC% TRIGEDIT-NUMARG NUMERICARGUMENT NUMERIC-ARGUMENT

4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n

Numeric arguments purpose varies depending on the trigger type. For most 
triggers it is the percentage chance of firing. But, it can also be the 
percentage of hitpoints remaining, location of an object, to match a string 
or single word in the argument, or the amount of gold for a bribe. To find 
out what numeric arg does for each trig look up that triggers help file.

OBJ-NOTES OBJECT-NOTES BOOKS PENS NOTES QUILLS NEWSPAPERS POSTITS POST-ITS OBJ-TYPE-NOTE PAPERS TYPE-NOTE

   With Object Type NOTE you can then use the A-desc to write what you want 
people to see when they read it.  Players will then be able to write on the
note by holding a PEN. If you want to create a book I suggest using object type
OTHER. That way players can read/look book but can not overwrite what you put
in the a-desc.
   To make a long book you have to use the extra descriptions with keywords
like 1 2 3 etc.  Since the buffers can only hold so much text. You would need 
to include instructions, something like this: to read another page type read #.
The player would type read 1, and would actually read page 1, then type read 2
and so on.

OEDIT OBJECT-CREATION OCREATE OEDIT-CREATE CREATE-OBJECT 

Usage: oedit <obj vnum>
       
This command will let you edit (online) any object within your designated
zone. If you specify an unused vnum, a new object will be created with that
number. 

@RGOTO 9@n to enter The Builder Academy hallway on how to use oedit.

OEDIT-A-DESC A-DESC ADESC ACTION-DESCRIPTION OEDIT-ADESC ACTION_DESCRIPTION  

4) A-Desc   :-
@ynot set@n
   Action Descriptions are used primarily for magical objects (staves, wands, 
scrolls, and potions) to specify what message displayed to the room when the
magical item is used. If no Action Description is present, a default message 
will be used:
Staves: Rumble taps <object> three times on the ground.
Wands: Rumble points <object> at Zemial.
Scrolls: Rumble recites <object>.
Potions: Rumble quaffs <object>.

   For readable papers, the Action Description contains the text on the paper.
@RSo unless your object is a staff, wand, scroll, potion, or note; DO NOT USE.@n
   I guess this needs to be repeated once more. A-desc does not normally need 
to be set. Except for the few instances listed above. It is not the object's
equivalent of the D-desc. If you want someone to see something when they 
look at the object add it in the extra description menu with the same keywords.

A-desc is not seen by the person using the object. Only by the victim and other
players in the room. The following variables can be used with it. 
  
$e he/she/it person using staff/wand/scroll/potion 
$E he/she target of staff/wand/scroll/potion 
$m him/her person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$M him/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion
$n char name person using staff/wand/scroll/potion (your name)
$N char name target of staff/wand/scroll/potion (other persons name)
$s his/her/its person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$S his/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion

OEDIT-EXTRA-DESCRIPTIONS OEDIT-EXTRAS

E) Extra descriptions menu
   When choosing this option you will be sent to the menu explained under
@RHELP EXTRA@n. This menu is used for both rooms and objects.
   Object Extra Descriptions allow players to examine certain aspects of 
objects defined by the builder, just like Room Extra Descriptions. There can 
be an unlimited number of Extra Descriptions per object.
   Take your time on making your objects and use extra descriptions, please!
For objects, be very liberal in how you describe them. Remember that a 
player's mental view on an object is based solely on what you tell them 
about it. There is nothing worse than looking at an object and seeing "The 
sword is big." Yes, this tells the player that it is a sword and it is big, 
but what else? What color? Is it sharp, notched, dull...? Make your objects 
interesting. Make your objects personal to the mob that carries them. If you 
make a cloak that loads on the wizard Throm, make it "The Magic Cloak of 
Throm" or even just "the wizard's cloak". Anything but just a plain old cloak.
Which would you rather have, as a player? When making extra descriptions ensure
that all the keywords are covered by the description. Extra descriptions can 
add small interesting details to your area and are often remembered by players.
Please take the time to write extra descriptions. On most MUDs, you can look
at 100 objects and "You see nothing special..." all 100 times. In an effort to 
make all MUDs different and better, take the time to write an extra description
for your object. Think of an object's extra description as the same thing as a
mob's description when you look at it, which it actually is. For the extra
descriptions keywords, use the same keywords as you did earlier. 
A very easy way to detect lazy builders with bad grammar is when objects
have no description at all. This causes frustration on the player side, because
when you have seen "You see nothing special..." once too many, you just do not
try to look at items anymore. 
   One of the most difficult things you will come across when creating an
object is giving it a good description. We all like descriptions, so take a 
little time to put your signature on the objects you create. Objects can give
the total sense of being within a certain world. They can also give clues as 
to what may lie ahead or what has happened in the past.

6) Extra flags : @cNOBITS@n

8)   NODROP          Item is cursed and cannot be removed or dropped.
9)   BLESS           Item is blessed (cosmetic).
10)  ANTI_GOOD       Item cannot be used by good-aligned characters.
11)  ANTI_EVIL       Item cannot be used by evil-aligned characters.
12)  ANTI_NEUTRAL    Item cannot be used by neutral align characters.
13)  ANTI_MAGIC_USER Item cannot be used by the Mage class.
14)  ANTI_CLERIC     Item cannot be used by the Cleric class.
15)  ANTI_THIEF      Item cannot be used by the Thief class.
16)  ANTI_WARRIOR    Item cannot be used by the Warrior class.
17)  NOSELL          Shopkeepers will not buy or sell the item.
18)  QUEST_ITEM      Shopkeepers will only accept questpoints for this item.

   Always try to promote role-playing. The last thing you should do is have 
Thieves running around wearing dangly bracelets making noise, Clerics and Mages
wearing large suits of armor and Warriors wearing delicate clothing. None of 
that makes sense! So, use your head a little while creating equipment. If the 
equipment gives addition hitpoints then it should probably be made of metal and
should be geared for Warrior types. We do not need Mages out there with bonus 
hitpoints on all their eq. 
   Class and Race restrictions are very important. Be sure to know what your 
MUD uses for both and build for them. For example, a Minotaur would not wear 
a regular helmet on his head. Minotaurs take pride in their horns, so their
horns must be showing. Minotaurs also have hooves for feet. It would be tough 
for most to wear regular boots. Use some common sense when creating your 
equipment. Think about each object you create. Think about who you are creating
it for. 
#31
OEDIT-ITEM-NUMBER OEDIT-NUMBER

-- Item number : 
   The first line lists the objects VNUM. This is critical; it is the identity
of the object within the game. It is the number that will be used to reference
the object from zone files and is the number used to load objects from within 
the game.

OEDIT-L-DESC

3) L-Desc   :-
@yAn unfinished object is lying here.@n
   The long description is displayed when the object is seen lying on the 
ground, for example, "A furled umbrella is lying here." Unlike the Short 
Description, the Long Description should end with appropriate punctuation 
and the first letter should be capitalized. Just like a full sentence with
proper grammar. 

Examples:
"Excalibur, the sword of all swords, lies here."
"A wooden barrel rests in the corner collecting dust."
"A fine emerald bracelet sparkles magnificently."

OEDIT-S-DESCRIPTION 

2) S-Desc   : @yan unfinished object@n
   The short description of an object is used by the MUD when the object is 
acted upon. For example,  a short description of "a long, green stick" would 
result in messages such as "The building assistant picks up a long, green 
stick." The Short Description should never end with a punctuation mark or begin
capitalized because it will be inserted into the middle of sentences. For short
descriptions, always use "the/a/an/etc." unless the item has a proper name. 

Examples:
"Excalibur" "the wooden barrel" "an emerald bracelet"

OEDIT-TYPES OBJECT-TYPES OBJ-TYPES OBJ-WEAPONS TRASH FURNITURE COUCH CHAIRS SEAT

5) Type        : @cUNDEFINED@n
   This specifies what type an object is defined as and controls the meanings
of value0 through value4 (option C). The Type Flag must be one of the following:
 
0    UNDEFINED      Do not set.
1    LIGHT          Item is a light source.
2    SCROLL         Item is a magical scroll.
3    WAND           Item is a magical wand.
4    STAFF          Item is a magical staff.
5    WEAPON         Must be piercing to backstab.
6    FURNITURE      Item may be sat on.
7    FREE           Do not set.
8    TREASURE       Item is treasure other than gold coins (i.e. gems)
9    ARMOR          Item is armor. Set AC in values, @RHELP OEDIT-VALUES@n.
10   POTION         Item is a magical potion.
11   WORN           Item is worn, but not armor.
12   OTHER          Miscellaneous object with no special properties.
13   TRASH          Trash is not bought by shopkeepers.
14   FREE2          Do not set.
15   CONTAINER      Item is a container. Be creative, make robes with pockets, etc.
16   NOTE           Item is a note @RHELP OBJ-NOTE@n for more info.
17   LIQ CONTAINER  Item is a drink container. Do not include liquid type in s-desc.
18   KEY            Item is a key.
19   FOOD           Item is food.
20   MONEY          Value set in the C) Applies. Cost not used. Max 1000 coins.
21   PEN            Item is a pen.
22   BOAT           Item is a boat; allows you to traverse water (noswim).
23   FOUNTAIN       Item is a fountain. Set Values to -1 to make it unlimited.

   Good items should be very rare, and hard to get. Lousy items should require 
much less effort. Give the most powerful items actually to a mob; Thieves and
Mages can often steal stuff on the ground without even bothering with the mob. 
Useless objects that can be easily obtained (on easy mobs or just sitting in 
the room) should be truly useless! Do not leave equipment that is actually 
beneficial lying around. This may sound obvious, but it has been done. 
   Also consider creating objects that are harmful to the owner. Objects that
lower certain stats, saving throws, or confer weaknesses make the game more
interesting. Remember that a lot of small items make an area more interesting 
than a few incredibly powerful items, for the most part. Do not limit yourself
to only armor and weapons. A giant untakeable monolith, and other strange and 
odd items can add a lot of atmosphere to an area. They can also be used to 
distract players. Most of the useless items are often best as trash, but can 
be worn, and do not be afraid of using strange wear flags. After all, who is 
to say that boat you just created can not actually be a ring of water walking? 
All that would be needed for that is to have a boat with a finger wear position 
set.
   You can and should add depth and interest to your area by creating objects
that do not have any game value. These can be rocks, candlesticks, toys,
clothing, or anything else you can think of. This makes the truly useful
objects more challenging to find, and it provides good props for people who
enjoy role-playing. Useless objects are typically type trash.

OEDIT-VALUES OBJECT-VALUES VALUES OBJ-VALUES

C) Values      : @c0 0 0 0@n
   The meaning of an object's four values (value 0 through value 3) varies 
depending on the Type Flag of the object. A table listing these values is
included below. These values are very simple and you do not have to use the
values below to understand them. When you select C You will be sent to a 
different menu depending on the object type.   

LIGHT 
   value 0: unused
   value 1: unused
   value 2: Capacity of light in hours.
      0: Burned out light.
     -1: Eternal light source.

      If less than 3 spells are desired, set unused values to -1.

WAND 
   value 0: Level at which wand's spell is cast.
   value 1: Charge capacity of wand (>= 1)
   value 2: Current number of charges remaining
   value 3: Spell number @RHELP SPELLS@n 

STAFF 
   value 0: Level at which staff's spell is cast.
   value 1: Charge capacity of staff (>= 1)
   value 2: Current number of charges remaining
   value 3: Spell number    @RHELP SPELLS@n

FURNITURE 
   value 0: Number of people that can sit on this object.

FREE - Not used. 
TREASURE - No values currently used.

ARMOR
   value 0: AC-apply of the armor.  Note that the effective change to AC is
this value times a multiplier based on where the armor is worn (Body X3,
Head and Legs X2). Positive values enhance AC; negative values hurt AC
(cursed armor for example).
   armor should be consistent with its description, meaning an item such as a
cloth shirt is not expected to be good armor, therefore it should not be.
Similarly, a tempered meteoric steel breastplate sounds rather impressive and
should be.

POTION 
value 0: Level at which the potion's spells are cast.
value 1: Spell number 1
value 2: Spell number 2    @RHELP SPELLS@n 
value 3: Spell number 3
  If less than 3 spells are desired, set unused values to -1.

WORN - No values currently used.
OTHER - No values currently used.
TRASH - No values currently used.
FREE2 - Not used.

CONTAINER
   value 0: Capacity (max containable weight) of container. -1 for unlimited.

     1)    CLOSEABLE      Container can be closed and locked.
     2)    PICKPROOF      Lock on container cannot be picked.
     3)    CLOSED         Container is closed when created.
     4)    LOCKED         Container is locked when created.
   value 2: The vnum of the key object that opens this container.
     -1 if it has no key.
   value 3: Reserved for internal use -- always set as 0.

NOTE - No values currently used.
KEY - No values currently used. 

FOOD 
   value 0: The number of hours of hunger satisfied by this food.
   value 1: unused
   value 2: unused
   value 3: Non-zero if the food is poisoned, 0 otherwise.

MONEY
   value 0: The number of gold coins in the pile.

OEDIT-WEAR-FLAGS WEAR-FLAGS WIELD-FLAG WEAR-FLAG

7) Wear flags  : @cTAKE@n
 
 1) TAKE        Item can be taken (picked up off the ground) (DEFAULT).
 2) FINGER      Item can be worn on the fingers. (2 positions)        
 3) NECK        Item can be worn around the neck. (2 positions)
 4) BODY        Item can be worn on the body, (AC multiplier = 3).*
 5) HEAD        Item can be worn on the head, (AC multiplier = 2).*
 6) LEGS        Item can be worn on the legs, (AC multiplier = 2).*
 7) FEET        Item can be worn on the feet.
 8) HANDS       Item can be worn on the hands.
 9) ARMS        Item can be worn on the arms.
10) SHIELD      Item can be used as a shield.
11) ABOUT       Item can be worn about the body.
12) WAIST       Item can be worn around the waist.
13) WRIST       Item can be worn around the wrist. (2 positions)
14) WIELD       Item can be wielded; e.g. weapons.
15) HOLD        Item can be held (the "hold" command).

   Wear position of body will cause the object to actually affect the
players armor class by AC of object times 3. Head and Legs are times 2.

   If you plan to have an object that is not to be taken, you can either remove
the take flag on it, or give it a large weight (50 max). This way, players 
will not be able to take it. By giving it a large weight this causes the code 
to say it is too heavy for you instead of "You can't take that". Good for 
statues, and funny when you see players dropping all their stuff and stripping
naked to get the things. Objects without take flags do not require a weight, 
cost, cost/day, applies, min level, and perm affects.
   Note that the TAKE bit controls whether or not an item can be picked up 
using the get or take command, whereas the HOLD bit controls if the object 
can be worn using the hold command. The wear flags determine how you can 
handle the object. Default is TAKE, but to wear armor etc. you need to give 
it a wear location. Note, however, that items without the TAKE cannot be 
picked up. Objects such as fountains or statues should have the take flag 
removed. 
   Make sure every object has an extra description, and that they are balanced,
both by stats, and by wear positions. To do this I would recommend that every 
zone has at least a complete set of equipment.  This prevents the typical MUD 
where they have 200 weapons, and 10 that can be worn on the wrist.  

#31
OEDIT-WEIGHT WEIGHT

8) Weight      : @c0@n
   The weight of the object. The weight controls how many strength points a 
character must have to take the object, and is used to calculate when bags 
and other containers become full. Every takeable object should have a weight 
of at least 1. Every object that can be taken should have a weight. Weight 
max for takeable objects is 30 (ex: body armor). Weight min is 1 (ex: ring).
Everything that has a take flag must have a weight. For weapons a  weight of 
18 means only a player with strength 18 or up can wield it. 
   If you do not want something to be taken you can remove the TAKE flag.

OFFER RENTING UNRENTING UN-RENTING 

Usage: offer
       rent

For use in the receptions of inns.

Offer makes the innkeeper tell you the cost of storing your belongings
for one day.  Rent stores your belongings and exits you from the game.
When you re-enter, you will start where you rented.

However, rent is free here, and you can simply quit.

OFFLINE-EDITOR CIRCEDIT CWC 

   A few builders prefer building on their home computer instead of on a MUD.
I DO NOT recommend this since there are no good offline programs. But if you
do not have Internet access and want to still work on your zones feel free to
try them out. I have used CircEdit and the newest CWC seems to be even better.

@[b315]@*[b315] - Background color of Red-3, Green-1, and Blue-5@n 
All 256 Color combinations can be seen by "show colour".

Advanced Examples:
@(HELP CLASS@) = A basic MXP link for HELP CLASS
@[U9814/Rook] = Creates a rook icon, or display the word Rook if the player's 
                client doesn't have that functionality
@<SOUND FName="ouch.wav" V=50 L=2 P=80 T="combat" U="www.yourMUD.com/sounds/"> 
              = Would play ouch.wav on an MXP/MSP capable client.

#31
PARDON

Usage: pardon [target]

#31
PASSWORDS PW

Ideally, your password should be something that nobody could guess.  In 
reality, most people choose a password that is easy to remember and they never
change it. While passwords on most MUDs are encrypted there is no rule that 
they have to be. So please NEVER use a password on a MUD that you use anywhere 
else. Choose a separate MUDding password and change it occasionally.

If you forget your password any IMP can reset it for you.

PATHS

   When building rooms, try to allow characters some freedom of movement. Do 
not create paths and trails that force you to go a certain way without any 
choices. Try and let characters get from point A to point B in a number of 
different ways, if possible. One suggestion for this is to have one pathway
through part of your area, using exit, extra, and room descriptions to show 
where the path lies. This way, observant players will be able to find the path
easily, whereas those players that are not quite as observant will get lost 
much more easily. Such hints can be hidden two or three extra descriptions deep
and be as small as a scrape on the side of a tree, a thread on a bush, or 
whatever. 

#31
PEACE %PEACE%

Usage : peace

   Stops all fighting within your current room.

#31
PERMISSIONS

   Access to the Oasis commands are controlled through a number of means.  
Of course, the master command list (in interpreter.c) specifies the minimum
level for a player to call the command.  This is typically set to either
LVL_BUILDER, or LVL_GOD.  A few commands are restricted to the implementor.

A player can always edit a zone and its contents if their name is in the
zone builders list (see ZEDIT for more information).  Finally, a player
may be granted OLC rights to a specific zone by means of the "set" command,
using "set <player> olc <zone>".

The implementor has unfettered access to all Oasis commands.
#31
PET-SHOPS PETSHOPS PET_SHOPS

   We are getting away from standard stock special procedures. Instead we are 
using a more flexible trigger to create petshops. @RTSTAT 338@n for an example
of a petshop trigger.

The OLD way: Make two rooms and some pets. The rooms MUST be sequential. if the
first room is 315 then the second must be 316. The second room is known as the 
storeroom. All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet. This room can not have any exits and will never be used by 
mortals. Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended. After 
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop. It will not work 
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted. The cost of pets is 300 
times their level.

PETS

   A few stores within the realm will allow you to buy pets. These pets are 
your obedient servants. As such you will be able to order them to do as you 
wish.

PLANNING

   There is a wide range of mistakes that builders can make when starting a new
zone. Zones that have had extensive planning before creation avoid most of 
these mistakes.
   Do you know the MUD? Most MUDs are meant for role-players. Do you know what 
the environment of the MUD is? Have you looked at the zones others have built?
I would suggest playing a mortal to at least level 10 before attempting to
build anything to get a feel for the realm. Most importantly, have you read the
background story? I was amazed at how few people read the background story.  
MUDs have themes, and it will always benefit you and the MUD to follow them.  
The best builders come to a MUD saying "I can build anything, what does the 
MUD need?"
   The first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit 
down and think about it. A zone should always start out on paper long before 
it reaches a MUD. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, 
develop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone theme you want to create. Is it
meant to be generic hack and slash experience zone? A wealthy populace to fill
the player's purse with gold? A quest for a special item? The possibilities are
limited only by your imagination. The important thing to remember is that zones
are built for players. Ask yourself, would you want to play in this zone?
   To help brainstorm I suggest you check out the many different zones 
available on TBA. All zones are required to have a zone description room in 
the first vnum of the zone. Goto 1900, 2700, 2900, 20000, 14500, or 15100 for 
some good examples. Feel free to look at any of the other zones listed under 
show zone. Beware, some may be unfinished and poor examples. 
   Assign VNUMs to your rooms/mobs/objects beforehand and write them down. Do 
not try and remember every VNUM you used mentally. Make lists of your mobs and 
objects. You can always add to the list later. After you have done all this 
you will already have a huge head start on your zone. Planning will pay off in
the long run.
   All in all, the best way to make an area interesting is to use variety,
intelligence, and imagination in building. Try to imagine what it would be
like for you to walk through and what you might try looking at or doing, and
then try to incorporate that into your area. Show your area to others and take
their advice. By taking all of this extra effort in creating your area, you
will be rewarded by leaving a lasting memory of your area in the minds of many
players. do not let your area fall by the unfinished wayside!  Work on it a
little every day, even if it is only one or two rooms worth of work. Likewise,
do not fill space by just making more of the same mob or duplicate room
descriptions. Take your time and do a thorough job, not one that is only 
superficially good.    
   It is recommended that you write out your descriptions on some kind of text
editor or word processor on your own computer before putting them on a MUD.
You can then cut and paste your descriptions in as needed. The advantage to 
this method is that if you accidentally wipe out your work on the MUD you will
have a ready backup. Be careful cutting and pasting to the MUD; if you send too
much text at once you will be disconnected.

PLAYER-SHOPS PLAYER-OWNED-SHOPS

As the name suggests, player-owned shops are shops owned by players.  They have
a shopkeeper and a 'stock-room'.

The shop owner simply places his unwanted items into the stock room, and they
instantly become available to buy in the shop.  The shopkeeper works like any
other shopkeeper, but only sells the contents of the stock room.

Unsellable or unrentable items cannot be sold, and simply won't appear on the
shopkeeper's list.

When an item is sold, a small pile of gold will appear in the stock room. The
shop owner can collect all the gold at their leisure.

Like a player-owned house, the stock-room is private, but guests may be added
by using the house command.  The stock-room also crash-saves so that the
gold or items for sale aren't lost in the event of a MUD crash.

#31
PLAYERBASE PLAYER-FILE PFILE PLAYERFILE PWIPES PLAYERWIPES PLAYER-WIPES

All the players that make up a MUD are stored in individual ascii files. When 
these files are erased it is called a pwipe since everyone starts over with a 
clean slate.

PLAYERS CHARACTERS NAMES

   This is who you are. Or at least who you are pretending to be. Put some
thought into your name, and write a player description. Be creative. If you
want to change names you must delete and recreate. Passwords can be reset
by any IMP. 

#0
PLIST PLAYERLIST P-LIST PLAYER-LIST

Usage: plist [minlev[-maxlev]] [-n name] [-d days] [-h hours] [-i] [-m]

   This command allows immortals to search through the player files using
specific criteria.

Examples:
   plist 0          - List everyone level 0.
   plist -i -h 2    - List all immortals that have logged in in the past hour.

#31
PLOTS

The plot of a zone is the main story of the zone. Such as: hack and slash, 
rescue the princess, find a precious stone, kill the dragon, or forging a 
special weapon.   Most builders do not take the possible ecology or economic 
effects of an area into account. By this, I do not mean having a mini-model of 
an actual ecological environment, but rather having things that make the area 
seem more plausible. The best things to put in to make an area more plausible 
are useless objects that actually add atmosphere to the area. Food sources for 
the mobiles in your area are always necessary to fleshing things out, as are
creating import and export goods for cities, complete with customs houses.
   Your zone should have a strong plot that is incorporated throughout. This
can be done by using the different descriptions available. Mobile look
descriptions and extra descriptions such as: trails, scrapings on the wall, 
etc. Trash objects can be created that are notes or maps.
   When designing your area and the plots within, you should always consider
what kind of player you want playing in your area. Keep the levels and types
in mind (i.e. role-playing, power-MUDder, etc). In doing so, try to have fun
building the area. Make it well rounded and something that you enjoy looking
through afterwards. If you find something you do not like, edit it and change
it until you like it. It is always best to build when you are not bored of the
area, since building when you are bored almost always turns out uninspired and
boring areas.
   If you are having problems developing a plot try visualizing a story that 
happens in your zone. For example, say a princess is captured somewhere 
and her relatives are looking for her. Next, you drop some clues to her 
whereabouts by putting conversations in the looked at description of mobiles. 
You can set up some mobs so that when you look at them, you get "You strike up
a conversation with the shopkeeper. He chats with you about the rise and fall 
of the price of wheat. Looking at the candy jar he sighs. You ask him why, and
he relates a sad tale of how he has not seen a little girl who used to come 
into his store in a long time." Granted, this is not as elegant as a trigger,
but not everyone can write them.    
   The point is that you interpret the looked at description as something more
than just looking, you can view it as a static conversation. You can then go
around the area and throw in a few room extras leaving a trail to where the
princess is. You can also put some extra descriptions on useless items lying
about to indicate where one may find the princess. Once at the princess, you
could have her relay a story of the location of a secret buried treasure in her
looked at description, a nice reward for the rescuing hero. You can set up the
buried treasure in a hidden container with no long description. Give it a
short description of "the ground" so they get the treasure from the ground, 
and only know where this object is by the tale of the princess. When your 
players stumble upon something like this, they love it.

POWER GOD-EQUIPMENT GODEQUIPMENT IMMWEAPON ULTIMATE UBER

   The majority of new builders begin by creating themselves the ultimate
weapon and armor. Go ahead if you must but it is pointless. As an immortal
you no longer need them. Creating the perfect items with every affection is
a complete waste of everyone's time. It will not be allowed into a balanced
game and will have to be redone. This is typical of people who are power
hungry and are building for themselves and not for others. That is not a
sign of a good builder (see @RHELP BUILDER@n).

Usage: practice [skill or spell name]

Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills.  You can only do
so in a guild, where a guildmaster can help you train.  You learn new skills
as you gain levels. A guildmaster can be found throughout the realms and will
charge you for your training. 

If you type practice anywhere other than with a guildmaster, you will get a

Initially I came to TBA knowing absolutely nothing about any sort of 
building, having wanted to learn but being worried about expectations,
difficulty etc. However, I eventually put in an application and found 
it an extremely supportive atmosphere. There are extensive help files 
on almost everything, there are no deadlines or pressures, and regular
staff members to help with any problems.

Was given the trial of building one basic room/object/mob first, and 
was then able to work on my own zone in my own time, and learn some 
of the more challenging aspects of building.

Thoroughly enjoyed and enjoying the whole experience and am now 
helping out as staff there myself. Regardless of how little or how 
much you know about building, if you'd like to give it a go, or are 
just curious as to what it entails then I wholeheartedly recommend 
coming by :).

I entered TBA with the hope of becoming a teacher. I've been building
for quite some time and my first impression was that of a pleasant 
MUD with a very helpful staff. I filled out an application form and 
was soon on my way. There is wonderful builder tutorial there, and 
despite the fact I thought I knew most of it, I read it all anyway 
and learnt much.

I was then issued with a trial vnum, that is 1 room, 1 object and 1 
mobile. And I described them to the best of my abilities. After some 
friendly suggestions my vnum was passed and I was set up with my very
own zone.

The whole reason I came was to help teach Trigedit, but I ended 
up learning many, many things that I had no idea were even possible.
I am currently working there as a staff member and would definitely 
recommend coming here whether you're an experienced builder and want 
to refine your skills or if you're absolutely new to building and 
have not a clue at all. Be assured, you'll be welcomed with open arms 
and treated politely.

Maren
   I'm so glad that you've been such a great resource. The lessons I learned at 
your BA have helped me develop areas for the MUD that I have played for 4 years. 
I can't thank you enough for what you've done.

Hey wassup man,
just thought I'd drop by and say hi!

Actually, I came to thank you for all your help
when I started doing this err zone making, the
creative writing process I realized has really helped
me out a lot, and is a skill that not many possess.

right now, my friends and I started a new enterprise
called meal deal.

so we're doing a lot of work for restaurants and stuff, 
and I've began to do restaurant reviews and pretty much
all the copywriting on the entire website and on the sales
kits and blah blah blah. it is a hell of a lot of writing.
so er yeah, keep up the good work. and I just wanna say
thanks.

I've been on TBA off and on from the time before Cruel World actually 
had players and TBA was just a building port to the time Cruel World 
shut down for good and TBA was all that was left.

When I originally went to TBA, I had just resigned from an admin
position on a MUD and was floating about. I saw an advertisement for
TBA and thought I'd see if there was anything to learn - and learn I 
did. It did not take long before I was helping others, and soon after 
that I meandered my way up the ranks to be one of their staff.

From a staff perspective, we always attempt to answer all questions 
and feel a commitment to improving the mud community - that of other 
MUDs, not our own. Rumble, who runs TBA's social side, has a strong 
sense of community and a desire to see others succeed. The rest of 
us have bought into his flowers-and-sunshine ideals and are trying 
to do our part... or haven't and are just using Rumble's resources 
for our own vision and enlightenment. In either case, all comers are 
treated with respect by the staff.

The intention of TBA is simple - it is all about serving builders. We 
cater to:

   -- those learning to build
   -- those simply enacting a vision for a zone
   -- those building for another mud
   -- learning to script with DG-scripts
   -- discussing building tips and techniques
   -- trying out pet theories 
   -- those seeking to expose themselves to the theories of others


There are no deadlines to work to but your own (though we do 
occasionally overwrite or erase older work for the sake of making 
space for newer work). It is my opinion that the staff is mature, 
service-oriented, and non-judgemental about building abilities.

If you wish to participate in any of the above, I believe we uniquely 
suit your needs. The only drawback is that while many building 
techniques are universal, we specifically teach the use of tbaMUD 
3.1 with DG-Scripts 1.0.12 and OasisOLC 2.0.6.

Happy Building!

TMC Listing: The Builder Academy 

There are a few places out there that are first and foremost
dedicated to helping out the MUD community. This is one of the
finest examples of such a place.

When I first entered the TBA, I was greeted by enthusiastic players
and staff members, who took the time to help me get started, and
showed me all the patience in the world while I finished the
application process.

The standard on TBA is generally very high, and it keeps getting
higher. There is a common consensus among both players and staff
that everyone, including those most experienced and/or most 
talented, has something to learn. Advice and honest opinions are 
given when requested, but at the same time every builder has the  
freedom to both experiment with unconventional building techniques, 
as well as a chance to learn or get better with traditional
tbaMUD tools. 

This is a place for builders who love to build, and the building 
happens in the friendliest atmosphere you could possibly imagine. I
have yet to meet any single person who wasn't open, kind and ready
to help with whatever you might need. And these people really know
what they're doing.

Before I started at TBA, I was completely drained of creative energy.
After a longer, rather trying Imm-ship, I felt unappreciated,
unmotivated and with the exception of a little private doodling in
Word, I had stopped building altogether. It took no more than a few 
days on TBA to make my mind start dreaming up new plots and
schemes, planning a huge library meant to be a place that can help
roleplayers evolve their clerics and mages at a scholarly level. I'm
thoroughly enjoying every moment in there because, more than
anything else, TBA remembers that building (and mudding in general)
before anything else, is supposed to be fun. 

Thank you for letting me work here at TBA, I've learned a lot of things, I'll 
never forget u guys, for sure. I still have much left to learn, but, in the time
I was here, you guys helped me a lot. Thank you!!!

   Aight, from past experience with MUDs, and seeing how and what others have
built on those MUDs that I have played, I have always wanted to learn how to
build myself and along with that, it is of good experience to have under my belt
for becoming a game designer. My feedback so for, up till this point, is all
positives. This is a great place for newbies like myself in the building world
to come, and even for those that are somewhat trained in the world of building.
The help files that you supply are great, and are detailed/descriptive in every
aspect The "higher" immortals/gods like yourself have been a great help also,
pointing out what I need to fix, which helps me out a lot, there is usually
always something for a person to improve upon, so any feedback/help for
correcting my mistakes is always a plus. I like how you set it up for the
beginner like myself to learn how to edit a vnum before we go about building an
entire zone get the feel of things before you start, and also have a person such
as yourself point out the errors, so that I can become better at building in all
honesty I probably would not have understood as much as I do now in such a little
time if it wasn't for the staff, the help files, and my passion for building and
you allowing me to do so you are all doing a good job. Keep it up.
CRISCAL

I think it was a brilliant idea to help get MUDs who need builders.... what they
need when I came into this mud via friend telling me the site I had absolutely 
no knowledge of how to make rooms/objects/mobs. Now I know a lot more about all 
three of those than I did before. I want to thank all of you guys for what you 
are doing :)

From: raven

I've wanted to thank you for running all this. Everything at TBA has been very
helpful to myself and the other builders I've been working with. Your service 
is much appreciated. So, again, thanks for keeping all of this running. I am 
sure everyone else appreciates it as well. Regards

Sylaer gossips, 'Just stopping in to see what's here and say that I appreciate a mud theme such as this'

Sryth:
Trigedit is still being actively developed at The Builder Academy (TBAmud), 
their website has pretty good documentation on the feature, and they have a 
full mud set up that does nothing but develop the code and teach people to 
use the OLC and scripting with excellent tutorials. The people are friendly, 
helpful, and knowledgeable.

PREREQUISITES CONSTRUCTIVE-CRITICISM

   Do you own a dictionary? Can you write in complete sentences? Builders
are expected to be able to write decent descriptions. Good MUDs will not use
zones that are grammatical nightmares. The goal of the Builder Academy is to
develop great builders, part of this requires a grasp on the English language.
We understand English is not the first language for most people, but that is no
excuse if you wish to be a builder. Most MUDs are not going to spend the time
to teach you proper English. At the Builder Academy we will try.  But, it
will take more effort on your part than ours.    
   Once you start your zone we will review it and make suggestions to redo or
fix parts.  This is perfectly normal and should not in any way be interpreted
as an insult.  The comments you receive may include a lot of nit-picky details
but once you are an experienced builder and have gained our trust and respect
we will not be going over your work as closely.  Try and learn as much as you 
can from this test and review process. Keep it in mind as you work on future
projects. It is the most direct and concrete way for us to teach you how to 
build.  Everyone wants builders, but they want quality work more.  We would 
rather have one good zone than ten mediocre ones.

PROMOTE PROMOTIONS ADVANCEMENTS RAISES LVLS LEVELS GAINS 31 32 33 34 RANKS RANKING HIRING JOBS STAFFING

   Here at The Builder Academy the level of an immortal generally denotes
their skill at building. This makes it easier for people to know who is in 
charge, who they can ask for help, and who they should be wary of taking tips 
from. I encourage everyone to help each other. Just realize that if the person
is not at least a Great God they may have relatively little experience.
  
Level 31 (Immortal) Anyone who is new to TBA and is working on their trial
                    vnum or zone.
Level 32 (God) An experienced builder that has proven their knowledge and is 
               willing to teach others. Level 2 and above is considered staff.
Level 33 (Greater God) An experienced builder that has contributed 
                       significantly to TBA.
Level 34 (Implementor) Welcor and I (Rumble). Welcor hosts and I administrate.

   Do not bother asking to be advanced, and if that is why you are here, you
are wasting your time. Note, this does not mean you are not a quality builder,
but TBA is not your typical MUD. On the contrary, we are here as dedicated
people to help you learn to build. Because of this the only chance of
advancement is if you are willing to learn to build and then help teach others.
If you are willing to give back to the tbaMUD community, and have the
necessary skills to do so, you will be advanced and given further privileges
to help teach others. Generally, if you have to ask for a promotion you will be
less likely to receive it. Performance is everything here.

PROPOSALS GUIDELINES ZONE-PROPOSALS PROPOSITIONS PROPOSE REQUESTS CRITERIA

Congratulations, you must have completed your first trial of building one
room/mob/obj. Your next task is to submit a zone proposal to prove you have
what it takes to properly plan out your first zone. It is extremely important
that you put some forethought into what you will be creating. Remember, zones
are built for others to play. Be sure to make it something a player will enjoy.
A zone proposal consists of an informal MUDmail to your Head Builder. It should
contain: the location, level, alignment, theme, plot, size, and any other 
important notes about the zone. Detailed descriptions and help files are 
available in the hallways starting from room 14 and 15.

One last word. No one here is being rushed to finish their zone, we have no
deadlines, so take the time to give your zone character.

Usage       : cast 'protection from evil' [self]
Accumulative: Yes (Duration)

PURGE DESTROY SACRIFICE UNLOAD DELETE-MOBILE DISINTEGRATE DECOMPOSE CLEANUP 

Usage: purge [target]

Purge destroys things.  If used with no arguments, it will clear a room of all
mobiles and objects, but will not harm players.  If the argument is an object,
that object (and all of its contents, if any) will be destroyed.  If the
argument is a mobile, the mobile will be destroyed, leaving its inventory and
equipment lying on the ground.

Players can not be purged on TBA. Immortals can not use the purge command 
outside of their zone.

Examples:

  > purge
  > purge sword
  > purge dragon

Corpses decompose after 5 minutes.

PUT

Usage: put <item> <container>
       put all.<item> <container>

  > put all.bread bag
  > put all chest

QEDIT QUESTEDITOR QUEST-EDITOR AUTOQUEST-EDITOR QEDIT-NUMBER

   Quests are created using the qedit command.  Ideally, the quests should be 
created in the same zone number as the questmaster, although some builders may 
prefer to add the quest in the zone where quest completion takes place.

Quests use vnums in exactly the same way as mobiles, object and rooms.  Each 
zone will normally have 100 vnums available (#00 to #99, where # is the zone 
number).  Usually, when creating the first quest in a zone, #00 is used, 
then #01, etc…

When you qedit <vnum> to create a new quest (or edit an existing one), you will 
see the menu in @RHELP QEDIT-MENU@n

See Also: QEDIT-MENU, QUESTPOINTS, QUESTFLAG
#31
QEDIT-ACCEPT

    This is the text that is sent to the player when they start the quest.  It 
should describe in detail exactly what is required to complete the quest.  The 
text is simply output on the player’s screen, so be creative here.  An example 
of an accept message text could be something like:

The questmaster rummages in a large pile of papers.
The questmaster says ‘Ah, here it is’
The questmaster says ‘Bob, the local butcher has offered this quest’
The questmaster shows you a hastily scrawled note, that reads:

I am willing to offer any plucky adventurer 10 quest points if they bring me a 
large dragon steak.  These are normally acquired from the large green dragons 
up on Wyrm Mountain.  My normal source got eaten last week, and I have a large 
order to fill.  I need these within 24 hours

Thanks, Bob the Butcher, Midgaard
The questmaster sighs.
The questmaster says ‘A tricky quest, but it’ll cost you 5qp to back out now’
#31
QEDIT-COMPLETED QEDIT-ABANDONED

 B) Completed      : [     @c0@n]  C) Abandoned   : [     @c0@n]
   The completed field is the number of quest points awarded to the player when
they successfully complete the quest. The abandoned field is the number of 
quest points that the player loses when they abandon a quest.  Players do not 
lose quest points if a quest timer expires, so this should really be zero for 
all timed quests.
#31
QEDIT-COMPLETION

   Just like the accept message, this is simply text that is output on the 
player’s screen when they successfully complete the quest.  Prizes (quest 
points, gold coins, experience points or an object) are automatically 
announced after this text is shown, so this text does not need to have that 
information in it.
#31
QEDIT-DELETE

   As the name suggests, this will delete this quest from the MUD.  You will be
asked for confirmation, in case you accidentally hit the X key.
#31
QEDIT-DESCRIPTION

   This should be a short description of the quest.  It is shown to players 
when they type quest list at the questmaster, and should therefore give some 
indication of what the quest requires.
#31
QEDIT-FLAGS

   These are toggles on and off in a sub-menu.  When you select option 6 from
the main menu, you will see the sub-menu:

1) REPEATABLE           
Quest flags: @cNOBITS@n
Enter quest flags, 0 to quit :

   Currently, only one flag is available, the REPEATABLE flag.  When you have 
finished turning this on or off, select ‘0’ (zero) to return to the main menu.
#31
QEDIT-LEVELS

D) Lower Level    : [     @c0@n]  E) Upper Level : [    @c30@n] 

   Players below, and above, this level will be unable to join this quest.
#31
QEDIT-MASTER

   The Quest Master is the mobile who gives out the quest.  Players need to 
find the quest master in order to join the quest.  Simply enter the mobile vnum
for the questmaster, and your quest will appear on their quest list.  Only one 
questmaster can give out each quest.
#31

 Q) Quit
Enter Choice:
#31
QEDIT-NAME

   This is simply the name of the quest, shown in qlist.  It should be short, 
but descriptive.
#31
QEDIT-NEXT

   This is the quest vnum of next quest in a chain.  When a player completes 
the current quest, the next quest will automatically be joined.  This allows 
for long quests with a number of ‘steps’.
#31
QEDIT-PREREQUISITE

   This is the object vnum for a prerequisite object. The prerequisite object 
should be in the player’s inventory in order for them to be able to join the 
quest.  It is not taken from the player when the quest starts.
#31
QEDIT-PREVIOUS

   This is a quest prerequisite.  The quest vnum entered here must have been 
completed by the player in order to join this quest.
#31
QEDIT-QUANTITY

   This is the number of times the player needs to repeat the quest.  For 
example, it could be the number of items the player needs to find in a ‘object’
quest of the number of mobs the player should kill in a ‘kill mob’ quest.  This
should be used with caution, however. In an object quest ‘picking up’ the same
object 20 times will also complete the quest.
#31
QEDIT-QUIT QEDIT-MESSAGE

   The quit message is sent to the player when they type quest leave.  Players 
can lose quest points for abandoning a quest (see “Abandoned” on the next 
page), so if they lose quest points, this text really should inform them of 
that.
#31
QEDIT-REWARDS QEDIT-GOLD QEDIT-EXPERIENCE QEDIT-OBJECT

 G) Gold Coins     : [     @c0@n]  T) Exp Points  : [     @c0@n]  O) Object : [    @c-1@n]
   
   Gold is the number of gold coins awarded to the player when they 
successfully complete the quest.

   Exp is the number of experience points awarded to the player when they 
successfully complete the quest.
   
   Object is the object vnum of a prize object that should be awarded to the 
player when they successfully complete the quest.
#31
QEDIT-TARGET

   The target depends on the quest type.  It is the VNUM that should be found 
by the player. The table below shows which vnum type is needed.

        @uQuest Type            Target@n
Object, Return Object        - Object VNUM
Find Mob, Kill Mob, Save Mob - Mob VNUM
Room, Clear Room             - Room VNUM
#31
QEDIT-TIME

   This is the number of ‘ticks’ or game hours that the player has to complete 
the quest.  If this is set, then the builder should really try to do the quest 
themselves, and time how long it takes (typing ‘time’ before and after the 
attempt), and then giving at least one extra ‘tick’ for players to complete it.
#31
QEDIT-TYPE

   There are a few different quest types.  When you select option ‘7’ from the 
main menu, you will be shown a list to choose from:

0) Object         - Player needs to find a particular object.
                  Ends: When the target object is picked up.
1) Room           - Player needs to find a particular room.
                  Ends: When the player enters the target room.
2) Find mob       - Player needs to find a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the player enters the same room as the target mob.
3) Kill mob       - Player needs to kill a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the target mobile dies, if the player lands the 
				  killing blow.
4) Save mob       - Player needs to protect or save a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When every mobile in the same room as the target is 
				  killed.  The target mobile should be the last mobile left 
				  in the room.
5) Return object  - Player needs to find a particular object, and return it to 
                    a particular mobile.
                  Ends: When the target object is given to the specified mob.
				  When you select this quest type, you are automatically asked 
				  for the mobile vnum to whom the object should be returned.
6) Clear room     - Player needs to kill all mobiles in a particular room.
                  Ends: When the last mobile in the target room dies.

Enter Quest type :
#31

RANDOM-THOUGHTS BIGGEST EGO

Random Thoughts came to us a while back wanting to learn scripts and with
his unique attitude and years of mudding experience, as well as his limited
ability to understand the code, he is an asset and a welcome member of the
TBA community.  He is also a part of the CWG community and enjoys spending
time helping those in need, or just helping to lift the mood of frustrated
builders with random misquotes.
He is most known though for the size of his Ego and for his ability to refer
builders to the helpfiles.

RANDOM-TIMING TIMING TRIGEDIT-RANDOM-TIMING TRIG-RANDOM-TIMING TRIG-TIMING TRIGEDIT-TIMING TRIGGER-TIMING 

Since random triggers fire every 13 seconds you can set how often the trigger
fires by modifying numeric arg to the following values:

1%   = 22 minutes
2%   = 11 minutes
5%   =  4 minutes
10%  =  2 minutes
20%  =  1 minute
50%  = 26 seconds
100% = 13 seconds

The actual equation is 100/numeric arg X 13 = time in seconds. 100/20 X 13 = 65 seconds

RECRUITING ADVERTISING ADVERTISEMENTS ADVERTIZING ADVERTIZEMENTS

   For those wishing to help spread the word about TBA, thank you! The
simplest way to help is to write a review at:@C
http://mudconnector.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&mud=The+Builder+Academy

@n   Also please spread the word to your friends and other MUDs. We provide
training to anyone who wants it and we even offer up TBA as a builder port for
other MUDs. 

   To prevent harassment of builders trying to learn we strictly enforce a no
advertising policy. The only exception is that you may post to the advertising
board in room 88 and the advertising section in the forums. There are far 
better places to recruit builders such as TMC.

   For Implementors searching for help to create their MUDs. The staff of TBA
is flattered, but we have plenty of builders and development to keep us busy
for years. If you are staff from another MUD here to evaluate a builders work 
before hiring them please contact any staff member.  We will vouch for good 
builders that have crossed our threshold and tell you our honest feelings 
about the abilities of each. 

   The harsh truth is that most decent MUDs have been around for a while and do
not need to advertise. They also usually require new builders to complete a 
zone or provide equivalent proof that you are a good builder. If someone says 
they just started a MUD and need good builders be warned most MUDs fail and 
there is a good chance you will lose your work. It happens to all builders 
eventually. Make sure whatever MUD you build for does regular backups and ask 
if they will provide you a copy of your finished work.

REDIT-DESCRIPTIONS ROOM-DESCRIPTIONS ROOMDESCRIPTIONS

2) Description :
@yYou are in an unfinished room.@n
   The description of the room is seen when players type "look," and when they 
enter. Select 2 to enter the room description while in redit. When you enter 
the room description for the first time make sure to type /c and hit enter to 
clear the current contents (You are in an unfinished room.) You edit the 
room description in what is called the text editor. @RHELP TEXT-EDITOR@n. 
Learn all of the text editor commands, they will be very useful.
   Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. Saving time or energy is not 
an excuse. Players who play in zones with multiple copies of a description stop 
reading the descriptions. The zone becomes monotonous, and hence the MUD does. 
If the MUD is boring, why play it? Why even build it? Changing a description by 
one or two words counts as copying as well. Always keep in mind that the game 
is meant to be fun, so frustration, boredom, and irritation when reading 
something must be avoided at all costs. There are very few exceptions to this 
rule, and believe it or not, building a maze is -not- one of them.
   In the room description itself, you should include the important things in
the room.  The next thing to consider is all of the long extra descriptions of 
things you are going to enter. You were going to enter nice long text 
descriptions of things, right? This is the new millennium and you are the 
culmination of centuries of evolution/creation and we cannot have zones like 
the Sewers where half the rooms are: "This is a long, boring tunnel. This is 
another long, muddy, boring tunnel."
   Some players are evil, some are good, and many are not even human. When 
writing descriptions be sure not to assume the nature of the character reading
it. For example, do not say "The warrior towers above everyone in the room" when
the character looking at him might be a giant. Some players may be flying,
some may be near death, some may be high level and fearless in your zone, others
low level and easily killed. Do not assume fear, thirst, anxiety, etc.
Remember mobs can be killed, move, or not load. Objects can be taken or not 
load, so never include them in the room descriptions.
Room descriptions must be at least 3 lines and no more than 13 lines (if 
you run out of space use extra descriptions). Rooms with less than three lines
are almost not worth creating in the first place, and more than 13 lines makes 
life difficult for the reader, especially when just passing through.
   If you feel you need a really long road, say the road is really long. A few 
rooms straight of a road or hallway or what not is pretty long. Do not feel the 
need to extend it. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or
so rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the 
room. These objects do not have to do anything, just break up the sparse rooms.
If you are pressured to write bigger descs or make more rooms, relax. The best 
zones are usually very small and their size should not be measured by how many
times someone has to enter w to go down the road, you can say something is any
size you feel like making it with words alone.

REDIT-EXITS DOORFLAGS REDIT-KEYS PICKPROOF REDIT-EXIT-MENU EXIT-BASICS DOOR-FLAGS EXIT-MENU PURGE-EXITS

Choosing to modify an exit will bring you to the exit menu. 

1) Exit to     : @c-1@n
2) Description :-
@y<NONE>@n
3) Door name   : @y<NONE>@n
4) Key         : @c0@n
5) Door flags  : @cNo door@n
6) Purge exit.
Enter choice, 0 to quit :

1) Exit to     : @c-1@n
This displays where the exit leads to. This is a room number.
NOTE: the room number (0) is illegal. If you make an exit, make sure to 
give it a place to point to. An exit to -1 means it does not exist. This
will create a one-way exit. To make it two way you also set the exit in 
the opposite direction in the destination room. Thanks to our coders you will
not normally modify exits this way, instead you would use dig or buildwalk.
@RHELP DIG @n|@R HELP BUILDWALK@n. Both are excellent time-savers.

2) Description :-
@yNONE@n
What people see when they look in that direction. i. e. look north.
These must always be complete sentences. For example, "You see the
main chamber of the temple." These can really flesh out a zone.

3) Door name   : @yNONE@n
This is a keyword field. A keyword is the word you use when you perform
an action. Such as opening and closing. It can be more than one word, but
the first word is the only one displayed in the output messages. i.e. Rumble
opens a <Door name>.

4) Key         : @c0@n
If you wish the door to be locked then you must first make an object of
type key. That object VNUM is then placed in this field. @RHELP KEY-BASICS@n.

5) Door flags  : @cNo door@n
Choosing this option will display a third menu to select the door type.
0) No door          -- Default setting
1) Closeable door   -- Door can be opened/closed/locked (pickable)
2) Pickproof        -- Door can only be opened with key (sorry thieves) 

6) Purge exit.
This last option is available to set this exit to default.
This will clear all values and set the Exit to : -1 (nowhere).

Instead of having to link rooms manually through olc we have implemented
Buildwalk and the dig command. See the help files on each for more 
information once you have finished your trialroom and have a zone. 

   Remember that for working two-way doors, the rooms on each side must have
matching door flags, doors, and zone commands to close them.

#31
REDIT-EXTRA-DESC REDIT-EXTRAS EXTRAS 

B) Extra descriptions menu 
   When choosing this option you will be sent to the menu explained under
@RHELP EXTRA@n. This menu is used for both rooms and objects.
   If you have a lot to say try to use extended descriptions and/or objects
to increase the amount of description in the room without bloating the room 
description too much. For doors, exits, and so forth, try to include an extra
description of the door (for example, one for "door wooden"). For extra 
descriptions, try to make one for each thing that you think a player would look 
at in the room description or in other extra descriptions. If there is one 
word that could mean two or more things, include them all if you like, or 
direct the player to another description for such.
Any noun in the room description that cannot be adequately described, but 
is hinted to play some sort of role should either outright exist as an object
or have an extra description in the room representing it.  This goes even if 
the idea of the object being of use is a mere smokescreen. Use extra 
descriptions extensively, to flesh out a room, exits, and objects. Hide info,
hints, tips and tricks in them.  
   Of course all rooms have a description. But very few ever have extra 
descriptions. For example, there might be something mentioned in the room 
description but when you type "look <<at what was described>>" it says "You do
not see that here."  If you mention a painting then a player who takes the
time to type look painting should see something, it does not have to be 
anything spectacular, just a simple painting of a lake and open field etc.
This is a very important part of building. How would you otherwise convey 
the feeling you have about an area, if you do not put it in writing. People
cannot read your mind. In the interest of yourselves, the players who are 
going to play your area (and to make the staff here proud :P), use those extra
descriptions.

1) Name        : @yAn unfinished room@n
   This line can be edited in redit by typing 1 and hitting return. You may 
then enter the name of the room. The room name is displayed before the room 
description when players look at the room. Room name should be formatted like 
a title of a book. First letter always capitalized. Do not use punctuation in 
the room title. Room title is not a complete sentence but all words except 
prepositions should have their first letter capitalized. For example, "The Clan 
Ranks of the Builder Academy" Think of it as the shortest possible description 
of this room. It should not contain any ending punctuation like a period.

Examples: 
"An Empty Dark Tunnel", "The Elcardorian Bakery", "Ms. Celande's Office"
"The Beginning of the End" "Two Paths Diverge in the Woods" "Jack's Trial Vnum"

RELSQUI

   How do you pronounce your MUD name?  It doesn't come up very much, being a
(usually) silent medium and all, but every once in a while I find myself
wondering.  The only thing people usually mistake about mine is the 'u,' which
is not silent.  Relskwee.  ^_^

REMOTES VSET RSET 

Usage: remote <variable> <id>

Remoting a variable saves that variable to the player file for future access. 
This is used heavily for quests to limit a player to only performing it once.
Here is a quick example from zone 14. The variable must first be set and then
saved to the players file via remote, like:

* setting the variable to 1 means completed.
set solved_example_quest_zone_0 1
remote solved_example_quest_zone_0 %actor.id%

Then in future triggers it is checked if that variable already exists in the
player file. In this example, if it does the player is not allowed to continue.
<variable> should always be a unique name. I suggest always including zone #.
<id> can be any value or text you wish to use later.

   Create a global variable belonging to a character or player whose id is 
specified. The variable must first exist in the trigger that is running.

REPLY

Usage: reply <message>

This command will send a reply to the last person to send you a message
using TELL.  It works just as if you had typed 'tell <player> <message>'
but makes it a bit easier.  It can also be very useful in case someone
invisible sends you a message.

Example:

Ras tells you, 'Hi!'
> reply hey
You tell Ras, 'hey'
>
Someone tells you, 'I am your secret admirer.'
> reply Who are you?
You tell someone, 'Who are you?'

REPORT-EXAMPLE

The following is Justo's monthly builder's report update. These are not required,
but encouraged. Justo's zone is the most in-depth and well planned zone I have
ever seen. I have never seen anyone put so much work into a zone. Kudos to Justo.
I am saving this because I would like everyone to use Justo's work as an 
outstanding example of how a builder should develop and plan a full zone.
 
 * * * * Midgaard Mail System * * * *
Date: Sun Oct 13 10:33:59 2002
  To: rumble
From: justo
 What I've been doing in Zone 151 :
 1) Connected existing street system with Zone 82.
 2) Have been zediting doors to remain closed.
 3) Improved keywords on several mobs.
 4) Added the appropriate extra descs to 15 objects. ( Still wish it would not
    say " A bottle of tequila of whisky." That is annoying.
 5) Fixed up some of the shops...shop 15102 is still a problem...but its
    finally functioning which is an improvement.
 6) Erased old quest triggers that are not in phase with my current concept
    for how the Zone should operate. Built some new ones that do conform
    to the new concept ( I'll explain that shortly. ).
 7) Built a realistic blunderbuss with your appreciated help.
 8) Edited some of the Intro stuff in rooms 15100-15102.  
  * My original plan was to create something which people could actually
    use to mud in the classical sense. But, I've rethought that a little.
    Since everyone comments that Tejas 1820 is unique...and maybe a bit
    alien, I've decided to make it into a more educationally-oriented
    environment by setting up "sector guide" mobs which interact with 
    players and provide descriptive/directional info. The player asks
    for help and those mobs provide it as best they can.
    I'll also be adding one hack n' slash area for players to do
    their usual thing...a Cantina. I'd initially intended to put
    in some authentic desert wilderness around my San Juan Bautista 
    fort where players could go out and interact with the Apache
    there and try to survive, but I'd rather allocate that Zone 82
    space to completing my town. I think that adding wilderness 
    ( actual frontier wildlands ) is going to require a third Zone
    when I get that far along. 
    As for the educational "sector guide" mobs...my big dilemma is
    trying to figure out just what the players might want to know about 
    Tejas 1820. I can Speech trigger those mobs...but what would a
    player bother to ask them ? All of them are ICly-justified 
    bilinguals or multilinguals in varying degrees of proficiency. 
    But, I need more feedback on what players would like to know about
    the Zone environment.  
    Maybe the way to go is to set up little instructional Quests for 
    the players. I might attempt that again.
    Before we had a Ranger player that went around with a char and  
    tested the Zones. What have we got in that regard now ?

#31
RESCUE

Some fighting classes only.

Usage: rescue [target]

   This command is useful if you want to try and make an attacker hit you 
instead of your poor friend who is being pummeled.  You can only 'turn' one 
monster for each rescue attempt.  This is very useful when playing in groups, 
of course.

Example:

  > rescue Yankee

#0
RESTORE REVIVE

Usage: restore <player | mobile | all>

   RESTORE restores a player or mobile to full hit, mana, and movement points.
Restore all will restore all players in the game. If used on immortals, it 
also sets all skill levels to 100%.

#31
RETURN CHEATING CHEATS

Usage: return

   Returns immortals to their regular body if switched into a mob. If not 
switched into a mob it will advance them to their original level. This is
used by staff so they can test triggers as mortals.

See also: SWITCH, TRIG-RETURN
#31
RLIST ROOM-LIST REDIT-LIST 

Usage: rlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Rlist gives you a list of the rooms within the parameters.

   rlist             - lists all rooms of the zone you are in. 
   rlist 13          - lists all rooms defined in zone 13.
   rlist 1300 1310   - lists all existing rooms from vnum 1300 to 1310.

SAVEALL AUTOSAVE SAVE-ALL REDIT-SAVE ZSAVE

   All OLC on TBA is saved automatically on exit with the exception of
buildwalk, dig, and room/mob/obj delete. These are left unsaved in case a new 
builder inadvertently buildwalks, digs, or deletes where they did not want to. 
Unsaved OLC is lost after a shutdown reboot. But, it is autosaved with a 
copyover or shutdown die. All other forms of OLC are saved by quitting and 
saying "yes" to save internally.

SAYS TELLS ASKS WHISPERS SHOUTS YELLS HOLLERS ' CHATS TALKS CHANNELS VOICES COMMON SPEAK SPEECH

Usage: say | shout | holler <string>
       tell | whisper | ask <player> <string>

   If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

Examples:

  > say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
  > tell catje hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:

  > ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 3 before you can use shout and yell.

T) Accept Types Menu
   This controls what types of items that the shop will buy. The first 
argument, called "Type" is the Type Flag of items the shop will buy. Numerical
and English forms are both valid (5 or WEAPON, 9 or ARMOR, etc.).
   The second (optional) argument is called "OBJ-EXTRA FLAGS" and allows you
to provide optional keywords to define specific keywords that must be present
on the objects for the shopkeeper to buy or sell it. 
 CAPS means flags, lowercase means object keyword.

#31
SEDIT-KEEPER

0) Keeper      : -1 @yNone@n
   Virtual number of the shopkeeper mobile, and its name. Shopkeepers should
be hard (if even possible) to kill. They should always be NO_SUMMON, NO_BLIND, 
NO_CHARM, NO_SLEEP. 
   Shopkeepers do not _have_ to buy anything. Or sell anything... On another
note, you can have two mobiles that look the same, but one is a shopkeeper and
the other is not. Shop keeping has some tricks to it as well. You can make the
shopkeeper wander, so players have to track it down to get the object they 
need for the quest. This can be a key he sells, where the key is disguised as 
something else like a ticket. 
   Shopkeepers could just be created so that they refuse to trade with any 
player characters.  The players will then wonder why the shopkeeper exists. 
Perhaps giving him a jewel will make him friendlier. In this way, an area can
be made infinitely more exciting by making some triggers. The possibilities
are endless.

SEDIT-MISTAKES SEDIT-ADVANCED

   The message "You cannot do that here." could be caused by the following:
Failure to set the proper room vnum in the room menu, not setting or loading
the shopkeeper and failing to purge and reset the zone. 
   Often new builders will get the message "There is nothing for sale." with
their first shop. This can be caused by two things. First, you have to give the
items you wish the mob to sell through zedit and make sure they loaded onto the
mob. Second, all objects that are for sale must have a cost. Shopkeepers can
not sell something with a cost of 0.
   Another common problem is that new builders wish a mob to sell an unlimited
number of an item. To do this the item must be added to the shops product menu.
Otherwise the number of objects the shopkeeper sells will be the number in his
inventory.
   You can not use the same shopkeeper or the same room to make multiple shops.

SEDIT-OBJ-EXTRA OBJ-EXTRA

   OBJ-EXTRA FLAGS are formed by Boolean expressions. The following operators 
are available:       ',^ = Not *, & = And +, | = Or
 
The precedence is Parenthesis, Not, And, Or. An example:
 
WEAPON [sword & long|short | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic

This shop will buy the following items of type WEAPON:
1. sword long magic
2. short magic (the first & is done before the first | )
3. warhammer magic
4. ^golden bow magic
 
Note that the ^ in front of golden affects ONLY golden, and nothing else in
the listing. Basically, the above expression could be written in English as:

[(sword and long) or short or warhammer or (not golden and bow)] and magic

If you want the shop to only buy ``short magic'' only if they were also swords, you could change the expression to:

WEAPON [sword & (long|short) | warhammer | ^golden & bow] & magic
                ^-Changes--^ 
 
You can also include object extra flags. The previous example used "magic" 
as a keyword that had to be on the object. If we wanted to make it so that the
MAGIC flag had to be set on the item, we would change magic to MAGIC. Similar 
changes could be made to add other flags such as HUM or GLOW. It should be 
noted that these expressions are case sensitive and that all keywords should 
appear in lower-case, while the flag names should be in all caps.

   The times (in MUD-hours) between which the shop is open. Two sets of
Open/Close pairs are allowed so that the shop can be open twice a day (for
example, once in the morning and once at night). There are 24 hours in a 
MUD day so setting closed to >24 will ensure the shop is always open. If you
want the shopkeeper to only be open during normal working hours you can set 
open1 to 9 and close1 to 5.

5) Sell rate   : @c1.00          @n6) Buy rate    : @c1.00@n
   The price of an object when a shopkeeper sells it is the object's value 
times Profit When Selling. It must be >= 1.0.
   The amount of money a shopkeeper will offer when buying an object is the
object's value times Profit When Buying. It must be <= 1.0.
   A pawn shop could: Sell at: [2.00], Buy at: [0.50]. Meaning it would sell 
items at twice as much as their worth and buy them at half price.

SELL

Usage: sell [#] <item>
       sell <#>.<item>

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around
to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
  > sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
  > sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)
  > sell 3.sword     (sell the third sword in your inventory)

SEND

Usage: send [target] <message>

   SEND displays the message to a particular person. This is meant to be used 
by teachers to send text to builders while in OLC. Combined with the snoop 
command this allows a teacher to see and tell builders what to do. Here is a 
little shortcut alias I use.

alias sa send alambil @M@MRumble sends you:@n@n $*

With this I just type: sa <message>. This will use color to catch his attention
and will list my name since send does not automatically show who the send is 
from.

Wiznet is now viewable while in OLC so if the MUD isn't too crowded you can use
that as well, but do not spam other builders.

SET DO_SET INVSTART NOWIZLIST
  
Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

@   
SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.
 
SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.
 
SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

SHAMRA

   First and foremost, repeat after me "Shamra is God".  Think it, know it,
drink it into your soul and make it a part of your very being.  My two favorite
hobbies are swords and killing, and it is even better when I am killing people
with swords.  From the time I was a lowly immortal I have always defied the
supposed bounds of my power and I will never be satisfied until it is absolute!
Now all that aside, I'm happy to help anyone who is willing to help themselves.
I am currently working on zones 89 and 327, both works in progress but 89 is a
bit further along.  I am oftentimes in another window or near my computer so
page me if you really need something, if I don't respond I'm probably sleeping

Usage: showvnums

   Toggles a flag which causes the virtual numbers for all room/mob/obj flags 
to be displayed. Also now shows if a trigger is attached.

3) Room flags  : @cNOBITS@n
The following room flags can be selected:

1)  DARK       - The room is dark, players need a light source, or infravision.
2)  DEATH      - Players die on entry. All dropped items will be junked.
3)  NO_MOB     - Mobs will not enter this room. This can be used to define the
                 zone where any mob can wander. For example, lower level mobs 
                 can be set so that only they can wander on the first level of 
                 a dungeon by making the stairwells NO_MOB. A NO_MOB room will 
                 not prevent pets and charmed mobs from following players. A
                 mob can flee into a NO_MOB room.
4)  INDOORS    - Weather messages will not be sent to room, always lighted. 
                 Call lightning will not work.
5)  PEACEFUL   - No violence will work here. Use sparingly.
6)  SOUNDPROOF - Tell, gossip, shout, holler will not be heard here. This flag
                 should be used sparingly also, it is very annoying IMHO.
7)  NO_TRACK   - Track will never find a path through this room.
8)  NO_MAGIC   - No magic will work here. 
9)  TUNNEL     - Only one person allowed at one time.
10) PRIVATE    - Only room for 2 players/mobs i.e. a tunnel or small space.
11) GODROOM    - Only allows Great God or above to goto.
12) HOUSE      - DO NOT USE. Room is a house.       \  automatically
13) HCRSH      - DO NOT USE. House needs saving.     >    set by 
14) ATRIUM     - DO NOT USE. The door to a house.   /    hcontrol

SHUTDOWNS

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause] [time]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down with the following different arguments.  

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD. OLC is auto-saved.
 
DIE        Kills the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.
 
PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in the root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
 
TIME       Time until reboot/shutdown. Omit to reboot/shutdown right away.

   This command sets the specified skill or spell to a percentage learned value
1-100%. Skills and spells are based on class and level.

skillset rumble 'magic missile' 100

#31
SLEEP

SLEEP is both a command and the name of a spell.

The SLEEP command puts you to sleep, allowing you to regain your health more
quickly.  You will be largely unaware of your surroundings while asleep.
You can awaken yourself with the WAKE command.

The SLEEP spell forces the victim into a magical sleep such that they cannot
be awakened until the spell wears off.

Usage       : cast 'sleep' [target]
Accumulative: Yes (Duration)
Duration    : 4 hours + level/4
Level       : Mage level 8.

If failing saving throw versus spell, the person will fall asleep.
A person who is affected by sleep can only be awakened if attacked.

See also: WAKE
#0
SLIST SEDIT-LIST 

Usage: slist <zone number>

Slist gives you a list of the shops within a zone.

      slist             - lists all shops of the zone you are in
      slist 12          - lists all shops defined in zone 12
      slist 3001 3022   - lists all shops from vnum 3001 to 3022

Once you have the list of shops you can "show shop <vnum>" to get more info on that 
shop.
 
See also: SHOW-SHOP, SEDIT, OLC
#31
SLOWNS SLOWNAMESERVER

Usage: toggle slown

The slowns command is deprecated after adding asynchronous host lookup.

Huh? Slowns toggles whether or not IP addresses are resolved into readable 
site names. If slow nameserver is enabled, USERS will show only IP 
addresses. i.e. 128.123.222.111 and not ip.hr.hr.cox.net.

See also: TOGGLE, USERS
#31
SNEAK

Thieves Only.

Usage: sneak

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking notice).
When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you're actually sneaking.
If you successfully sneak, then you'll continue to sneak for a little while.

See also: HIDE
#0
SNOOP

Usage: snoop [player]

Snoop allows you to see everything another player types or can see. This will 
be displayed on your terminal preceded by a '%'. To prevent abuse snooping 
someone is logged in the system files.

Snoop is meant to assist teachers in helping builders and to ensure players do
not cheat. With builders it allows you to see what they are doing wrong and 
correct them. It should be used in conjunction with the send command. Snoop 
shall only be used to assist people when building and enforcing rules. It is
not meant as a tool for spying.

Type snoop <your name> or just snoop to stop snooping.

#31
SNOWLOCK

   Not everything present in my zone was in my original plan.  I got a lot of
ideas from everyday life, unexpectedly, rather than from a quest for a certain
style or taste.  The only thing significant that I think I've done, which most
builders do not realize, is to keep my eyes open all the time, and look at 
ordinary things with a stranger's eyes, as if seeing them for the first time.  
Thus the descriptions do not end up as a list of boring details, but rather, 
exclamations of wonderful, magical, and perhaps even horrible things yet to be 
noticed.  

#31
SOCIALS ALIST

Usage: socials

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

Usage: <social> [target] <body part>

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Examples:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > kiss rumble foot

SPAM

Spam is the repeated use of a command, or series of commands, that cause 
excessive screen scroll for other players. This means repeating yourself 
over and over on any channel, putting a lot of things in a container at a 
populated room, and a series of socials used in quick succession.

All spamming should be reported and will be dealt with by the staff.

#0
SPATIAL-ORIENTATION BIAS

   Do not use direction bias. Words such as behind, in front, to the right, etc. 
should never be used because you never know which direction a player is facing.
Use cardinal directions; north is always north. Do not assume that characters 
have been in this room or surrounding rooms before. For example: "This room is
even colder than the surrounding chambers." If you have not been to all of the 
surrounding chambers, or have teleported in somehow, this would make no sense.
Another common problem is "This path continues to climb steeply uphill." If 
you were coming from the uphill direction, would not it be climbing downhill?
   Do not use movement bias. This means that when writing a description, do not
say "You are walking on a path" because you never know. The player could be 
flying, levitating, slithering, crawling, stomping, or anything in between. Do 
not use time or season bias. This means that when writing a description, do
not say "The sun shines powerfully through the window". At night, that will not
make sense.
   Also take into consideration all the different races and classes. Some 
races and classes may not need air, food, or water. Some may not have feet, 
clothing, eyes. Pretty much anything is possible, so know the MUD and its
mortals before you start building.
   Try to make your area interesting for all the major character classes, not
just warriors or mages. Build in parts where thieves and clerics have a
special part to play. By the same token, do not assume all anyone wants is
+damage equipment. 

#31
SPECIALS SPEC-PROC SPECIAL-PROCEDURES SPECPROC SPEC_PROC

   Special procedures are used to allow certain complex functions to rooms,
mobs, and objects. They are written by coders and are normally not created
by builders. If you have something you wish to assign a special procedure to
talk it over with a coder. The most common special procedures include:
Postmasters, banks, guildmasters, pet shops, and boards. If your zone requires 
any of the above mudmail your coder after your zone is complete.
   Most of the things possible through special procedures can now be done
through trigedit. 

To create a postmaster make a mob, set one of the keywords as "postmaster," set
the NPC flag SPEC, and load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder add
to spec_assign.c:110:  ASSIGNMOB(#, postmaster); NOTE: # = the mob/obj vnum.

To create a guildmaster make a mob, set one of the keywords as "guildmaster," 
set the NPC flag SPEC, and load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder 
add to spec_assign.c:69:  ASSIGNMOB(#, guild); A player can practice at any
guildmaster, it is the guildguards that usually limit who can access what
guildmaster. @RTSTAT 133@n

To create a bank make an object, set it to type OTHER, add keyword "bank" and
load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder add to spec_assign.c:
138:  ASSIGNOBJ(#, bank);

To create a board make an object, set it to type OTHER, add keyword "board" and
load it to the room via zedit. Then have your coder reference boards.c for the
remaining instructions.

To create a petshop see: @RHELP PETSHOP@n.

In all cases special procedures need to be added in by a coder. Once your zone
is complete mudmail your coder for the additions you want including type and
mob or object vnum.

SPLITTING

Usage: split <amount to split>

Split is used to divide money equally amongst players in your group who are in 
the same room as you.  If you are in a group with four other people, all of 
whom are in the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100, you will give each 
of the other four group members twenty coins each.  (100 coins is split five 
ways; you keep your share and give everyone else their share).

STAFF DUTY DUTIES STAFF-DUTIES TBA-STAFF-DUTIES TBASTAFF

   This is how we handle new arrivals on TBA. Read the helpfiles on send/snoop.

1.  Have them fill out the application at: @Chttp://tbamud.com/@n
    They must submit the application before being advanced. 
2.  Advance them to Immortal.  <advance Rumble 31>
3.  Transfer or teleport them to 3, Socrates will greet them with instructions. 
4.  Tell them to read through the entire zone and follow its instructions. 
    Remind them that if they get confused they can ask for help over wiznet.
5.  The entire zone should take well over an hour to read. A trigger will tell 
    them at the end of the redit hallway that they can begin working on their
    trial vnum.  Great God's and Implementors will assign trial vnums and zones. 
6.  Be available for questions, but don't hand feed them everything. If you do
    you will get burnt out or become suicidal. Help <X>edit, shows the room 
    number for each hallway. I have compiled an extensive help system so the
    majority of the questions can be answered by directing them to a help file.
7.  Once they complete their one room/mob/obj look it over. Check everything. 
    Anything you miss will be repeated up to 100 more times with their new zone. 
    Any corrections now will save us (and them) major headaches later! 
    STAT ROOM/MOB/OBJ to be sure everything is correct. 
8.  After the trial vnum is approved tell them to read HELP PROPOSAL. A zone 
    proposal is required before they will be given a zone.  
9.  Finally, make sure to have fun. If you don't want to deal with newbie's go
    invis. Everybody gets tired of training eventually. I know it gets hectic
    at times, just do your best, keep your cool, and remember to breathe ;-)

Feel free to submit contact info to rumble for the HELP EMAIL entry.

Great God's:
    Use any free trial vnum in the zone listed in imotd. Set their trial vnum 
    in their title "set rumble title has trial vnum #" "set rumble olc #." Put
    their name in their trial vnum room title. Use the assigner to limit them
    to their single vnum. HELP ASSIGNER. In the rare occasion that I am absent 
    @HHELP STAFF-ZONES explains how I setup new zones.

STAFF-ZONES
 
   Ensure their trial vnum is complete and they have submitted a zone proposal. 
In my absence they can mudmail it to you directly. SHOW ZONES and then search 
for a "free zone" I usually save zones <100 for people I know will complete
them. Don't waste them on a typical newbie. Next redit #00 and enter the room
name "Rumble's Zone Description Room" and cut and paste the zone proposal into 
it. It may require a little cleaning up and if it is extremely long use the 
extra desc. Next zedit #00 and put their name under Builders and Name Me - 
Rumble for the zone name. Then set olc, title, nohassle on and purge the 
assigner (or have them junk it).
 
I use the following ZMUD trigger. It fires off me typing aaz # <builder>:

STATISTICS STATS STRENGTH INTELLIGENCE WISDOM CONSTITUTION DEXTERITY CHARISMA 

Statistics (Stats)- How your character measures up mentally and physically. 
A list is below:

Wisdom       - How wise you are. Helps in combat, and when regaining mana.
Constitution - How healthy and robust you are. Determines how many hit points
               you gain per level, and how well you heal.
Dexterity    - How agile you are. How many movement points you gain per level, 
               and how well you dodge attacks, pick locks, and kick without 
               falling over.
Charisma     - How personable your character is. This can affect shop prices
               and charm spells involving the living.
Strength     - How physically mighty your character is. Determines how much 
               stuff you can carry, how heavy a weapon you can wield, and what 
               kind of bonus is added when  you hit things. 
Intelligence - How smart you are. Determines how much mana you gain per level,
               and how much you regain per hour, if you can outsmart your 
               opponent and hit him more often, and if you're undead, helps 
               control your followers.

STEAL

Thief Only.

Usage: steal <item> [target]

Use steal to steal gold or items from people.  The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Examples:

  > steal gold drunk
  > steal sword mercenary
    (If it is wielded, only possible if he is sleeping)

@nunpublished work Â© 2000 Elizabeth Hoefling Last Modified: Feb 19th, 2004
     @celaseth@*tbamud.com@n

@cDisclaimer@n: The opinions herein belong solely to Elizabeth Hoefling. Some 
games look for different things when building, but overall any zone made by 
these rules should be good for most MUDs.

@cThe Beginning of a Zone@n:

The first thing to do when sitting down to build a zone is just that - sit down
and think about it. Every zone starts with an idea or a spark. From there, 
develop it. Pay attention to what kind of zone you want to create. Is it to be 
an exp zone? Gold/money? Equipment? Quest? A combination of each or something 
else entirely? Evaluate the idea. Would you want to play in this zone?

After you have this part worked out you're ready for the second step, mapping 
it. Some really neat people prefer to map with graph paper, but that's not 
necessary. Any paper will do. The reasons behind mapping are simple. It 
solidifies what you're planning to build into mud terms. Also, though final 
products rarely are an exact copy of the map, they provide a concrete reference 
for you to look at when the builder's block question rears its ugly head "Hmm, 
what do I build next?" Lastly, not all players have nifty clients especially 
made for mudding with auto-mappers, etc. We wouldn't want those poor 
unfortunate souls to be at more of a disadvantage than they have to be... and 
maps are highly important to knowing a mud, even if you keep them all in your 
head as a few players do. 

When creating your basic map, it is also a good idea to number the rooms on your
map so you can keep track of vnums by the last two or three digits as well as 
know exactly which room is where if you need to go back and change something. 
It saves you having to dig through several vnums trying to find that one place 
where you have to reconnect an exit. Just create each vnum with the 
corresponding map digits and it is smooth sailing.

Now that you have an idea and a map, it is time to actually start building. And 
this is where the term stylistics comes into play. These are the do's and 
don'ts of building that surpass simple knowledge of olc. Some of these rules 
depend on the kind of mud you play, but most are tried and true for a nice, all
around, every-mud-can-use-it zone.

@cElements of Style@n:

Most of us know that many players do not read descriptions, but that the mud 
environment would be ever better if people did. As builders, we want them to 
read because we're not only putting a lot of work into what we do, but because 
these descriptions and the areas they represent intrinsically represent the 
virtual world of your game.

All descriptions should encourage players to read. First, by being well-written
and simply bearing artistic merit. Second, by ensuring that they are absolutely
necessary to achieve the goals of the game! If your game is made for experience
and equipment gathering, and failure to read descriptions directly impedes this
goal, then players will learn to read everything. If your game is made for 
exploring or role-play, most of your players probably already read them Â- 
because knowing their environment is a basic requirement of play. In any case, 
builders exist to ensure that the goals of play are supported by game 
descriptions.

Game environments benefit from complexity, especially complexity that comes in 
a palatable form (such as simplicity). There exists a certain pleasure in 
discovering depth anywhere, especially if it is truly a discovery. Hiding deep 
meaning behind descriptions, areas to find, special items, unique nooks and 
crannies to spend time socializing, and hints that point to these things 
elsewhere outside of your own zone is an excellent idea. In fact, if you 
don't wish to be building descriptions no one will read, you should employ 
special secrets Â- most especially on games where knowing one's environment 
does deeply affect a character's development. No matter what kind of zone you
are building, keep it interesting throughout!

Most rooms or things that belong to a zone should play an actual part in the 
world. If building a residence does nothing but add rooms, don't bother adding 
it. It is entirely possible that small parts of the zone are there entirely for
flavor, or to provide a place of a specific atmosphere to the game for certain 
types of play. This is fine, but make certain that your zone fulfills the 
game's basic design. Plain and simple, if these elements do not exist, the zone
isn't interesting and is not worth building. 

I suggest having something special every three or so rooms, even if it is only a
minor addition that doesn't even connect to the zone itself. Such as finding a 
sigil of office on a door, or old burned bones in a ditch on the side of the 
road.

@cStylistics - Rules and Explanations@n:

1) Write complexity into your zone. If you don't write well, you probably 
   shouldn't be the sole builder of your zone. Instead, seek the assistance of 
   someone who adds creative merit to your descriptions. You can do practically
   everything from plot to secrets to minutiae, even write the zone in full and
   just ask someone you know who writes well to Â'say it better' and rewrite 
   what you intended to have there all along. Novels have editors, and so 
   should any zone.

2) Add secrets! Reward players for participating in the game that the zone 
   represents. Always include at least one interesting thing per three or so 
   rooms. For example, have a bench in the garden or a table loaded to the 
   room. Many objects don't have to do anything, just break up the sparse 
   rooms. A good amount of these things should do something to enhance a 
   player's gaming goals, however, for the sake of forcing the player to read
   what you're taking the trouble to write.  Don't forget to add difficulty 
   levels as well. Not all secrets should be highly difficult to discover. In 
   fact, most zone-defining secrets should be the easiest for a player to 
   discern and puzzle out, harder enigmas become the reward for replay or truly
   deep thought, unnecessary for those of lesser time/intellect/interest to 
   simply relax and enjoy the game.

     @cNote@n: Remember that gaming goals define a game, so H&S zones will want
     to reward with good equipment or experience while RP games may wish to add
     something social such as access to a special area their guild can take 
     over with relative privacy, etc.

       @cRecommendation@n: document these somewhere for easy admin look-up.

3) Never, ever repeat yourself. Do not clone rooms without a specific reason. 
   Saving time or energy is not an excuse. Players who play in zones with 
   multiple copies of a description stop reading the descriptions. The zone 
   becomes monotonous, and hence the mud based upon it shares that failure. 
   If a zone bores people, why play it? Much more importantly, why build it? 
   We're talking about a great deal of work here. Changing a description by 
   one or two words counts as copying as well. If you feel that a teacher at 
   school would even consider calling your two descriptions plagiarism when 
   compared to each other, change them. Repetition is redundancy. Who wants 
   something they're working on for several weeks to be seen as redundant?

4) If a builder uses fantasy, they must make the relations necessary for 
   players to suspend disbelief.  Builders, of course, attempt to circumvent 
   reality and shape it to their will. Properly suspending a player's 
   disbelief requires acceptable explanations for it to work, ones that allow
   them to draw on their own experience and understanding of their environment.
   For example, let's say a player walks north and returns to find themselves 
   in a different place than where they left. Why did that happen? If this 
   isn't something a player expects as a result of their actions, or a reason 
   hasn't been offered to explain away the situation, the builder fails in 
   suspending disbelief. Instead, players think it is broken, or it is an OOC 
   attempt to screw them over, etc. So, if the physics of your world do not 
   match the physics in our world, inform your players through your 
   descriptions as to why their assumptions fail.

5) If a zone is overly complicated, simplify it. Creating something that has 
   nothing to do with promoting zone's purpose in which a player must solve to 
   gain anything from the experience only frustrates players. This does not 
   mean don't make the zone complicated or difficult, but use good judgment as 
   to what is overly provoking to a player in a useless manner. A good rule to
   follow is that if it is complicated and has nothing to do with a zone's quest
   or purpose, don't make it necessary to achieve that purpose. My favorite 
   example for this "abuse" is adding secrets and failing to leave hints in 
   descriptions about how to solve or find them, such as a maze without even 
   telling the player why they're in one or leaving any clue on how to solve 
   it. If they cannot achieve their goal without solving a puzzle, that puzzle 
   must be directly related to that goal.

6) Rely on words to keep it interesting. Don't feel the need to extend a zone 
   simply for the sake of scale. If you're pressured to write bigger descs or 
   make more rooms, relax. The best zones are usually very small and a 
   description's not limited to the number of times someone has to enter 'w' 
   to go down the road- you can say something's any size you feel like making
   it with words alone. Remember, words are the main tool of describing things,
   not special code effects, number of rooms, or colors. These things alone 
   never convey the feeling of a complete zone.

@cThe Polish @n(I.E. Picky Stuff)

1) Do not use the word 'is' in descriptions. It is generally accepted by the 
   literary community that the active voice is more powerful and eloquent. 
   Dodging the use of this word enriches descriptions in another way as well 
   as forcing you to use the active voice. It is easy to describe something as 
   it is red, it is big, it is heavy... and the word 'is' becomes repetitive. 

2) Do not to use the word 'you' in descriptions. It creates almost 90% of 
   direction bias and movement method errors, as well as the classic "telling
   the player how to think or feel".  In any case, the small percent of 
   innocent uses of the word  'you' are easily written with other terms, and 
   getting used to writing descs without it means you don't have to constantly 
   be on guard for these three blunders.

3) Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, don't tell
   someone they're sad, write the description to make them weep. The same goes 
   for scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not 
   simply say they are.

4) Be extremely careful when building with color. Especially if you're adding 
   it to your room descriptions. Try not to use more than one, and usually you 
   shouldn't use them in the text at all, only in the room title. On objects 
   and mobs this rule is more relaxed, but if it is part of what the player 
   automatically sees when entering a room, it is probably best that it not be 
   too colorful and should only have 1 alternate color in it. Color is the 
   hardest thing for many good builders to learn how to use properly. Don't be
   disheartened or surprised if asked to change even a minor amount of color. 
   If you use color, -always- terminate the color correctly according to your 
   mud's system.

5) Never put a period at the end of a room title. Write all titles as you would
   the title of a book, capitalizing all words except for a, the, and the few 
   excluded prepositions like 'of'. Short descs on mobs and objects should 
   always include the article or a measure word like 'some'. Long descs must 
   have the keyword of the object in it. In fact, it is usually best to write 
   the keywords -after- writing the short and long descs. A player should 
   never have to guess what the keyword is to affect an item. If they can see 
   it, they should be able to refer to it.

6) Never describe a mob that's loaded into a room in the room description, and 
   if the mobile is sentient (like a humanoid or race), it simply must be a mob 
   and cannot appear in the room description. An example such is butterflies 
   circling a bush. That's fine if the butterflies are not supposed to be 
   sentient and are not loaded into the room. You should never describe drunks 
   at a bar in the room description of the bar, instead put them there as mobs.

7) Always write extra descriptions and ALWAYS add at least one extra desc to 
   all objects including all of the general keywords so that the player can 
   look at whatever they pick up. Always. If your game supports a certain type
   of description in addition to the typical ones, such as exit descriptions, 
   use them consistently.

8) Any noun in the room description that cannot be adequately described should 
   either have an extra description in the room or outright exist as an object 
   to represent it.  This goes even if the idea of the object being of use is 
   a mere smokescreen. 

9) When building streets or any other generic structure with a name, give it a 
   meaningful or fanciful name. The Main Street is boring and overused in 
   almost all cities. Each city on a mud should have streets with unique names.
   Same goes for the "Central Building" or " West Wall". 

10) If you describe an object, mob, or anything else in the room desc, do not 
    add it to the room and vice versa. This means if I describe a table in the
    room desc, it should not be a visible object for the player to see in the 
    room. The reason for this goes back to the idea that you should never 
    'repeat yourself'. 

11) Try not to describe objects that a mob is wearing in their look desc, and 
    never do it if you're actually going to load the eq onto the mob. The 
    player will see it twice when looking at the mob.

12) Do not write about the considerations of a player or thought processes. 
    Don't ask questions in a room desc. Try to describe the looks of the mob 
    you're writing about in the look-desc. The trick of making a mob say 
    something when looked at can be handled with scripts, and a player should 
    be able to see what they look at as if they're doing so in real life.  
    Remember that your job with descriptions is to create an interactive 
    environment that the player sees, hears, etc. This means that your number 
    one goal is to be eloquently descriptive, but to do it in such a way as to
    simulate natural input as well as possible.

13) Never just describe the important things in a room, always try to describe 
    the room in its entirety, given the acceptable space. Do not focus only on 
    the information a player needs to know. Things that are important, like 
    that special hammer, or the doorway behind the painting should be found not
    because they are the only thing the player sees, but because of hints or 
    thought based on everything they see. For example, if I walk into a room 
    and see blank walls and a description that simply screams 'This object is 
    important, more important than anything else at all!', people won't think 
    on what they're seeing and will lose a great deal of the point of 
    descriptions in the first place. In addition, do not do the opposite and 
    make something else seem of importance that is not while trying to hide the
    true answer. Such misdirection will lead to player dissatisfaction... the 
    thing that we are trying to avoid wherever reasonable. 

14) Room titles should be original in nature. This means for the most part, do
    not copy room titles. A person should be able to look, and by title alone, 
    know exactly where they are. There are exceptions (like roads), but try not
    to make them too common, and you can break those room titles up with 
    prepositions, etc, as well. Ex: Thistledon Road by a Willow

15) Room titles should pick out the most important thing in the room or give 
    the room a name to go by. For example, 'By a Patch of Daisies' if daisies 
    are the most prominent thing or a name such as 'The Green Room'. Try not to
    describe the title in the description of the room as the only item in the 
    room. In some cases, if the room has a name, try not to redescribe the title 
    with the same words. For example, if the room title is 'By a Patch of 
    Daisies' there really is little need to add the daisies to the room desc. 
    It is acceptable to do so, but be descriptive in these instances instead 
    of repetitive. 


@cRules of Practicality@n:

1) Make sure the zone has a main goal. Every zone should have one before it is 
   built. If it is defeating the necromancer in the tower, setting the prices of
   the local stables, giving someone a realistic role-play environment, or just
   killing everything in sight, make sure you know what it is supposed to be 
   before you start building. 

2) Anything a player can see, he or she should be able to refer to. Be certain 
   that your keywords are intuitive.

3) If a mob is not humanoid they probably don't have money, and don't go around 
   wearing all that much by the way of clothing. It is unrealistic for them to 
   have it, so don't give it to them. If you want to reward the player for 
   killing them, give them a pelt, teeth, claws or something to be sold. See 
   rule #314 for more info.

4) There should be between three and eight lines of text in a room desc. 
   Proper grammar should be used at all times in said text. Going over 8 lines 
   can be a bad idea because of the limit of player scrolling and how daunting
   that amount of information becomes in a single dose. If a description 
   stretches too long, don't hesitate to go back and cut points out to make 
   into extra descriptions. Extra descriptions improve zones, use them a great 
   deal! If a room does not have extra descriptions, it is not a worthwhile 
   addition to a zone.

5) Do not use direction, movement, time or season bias unless the ability to 
   recognize these things is built into the game. If you can write 
   descriptions that will only be seen in winter, writing a winter description 
   adds to the game. If this isn't possible, writing a winter description 
   detracts from the game, even if seasons aren't coded. If they are 
   recognized, and you're just too lazy to write descriptions for every 
   possibility, do not mention the possibility at all.  For a simple reminder:
 
     Direction Bias: This means that when writing a description, don't indicate
     or insinuate that a player is going or looking in any one direction. An 
     example of a violation of this rule is "The castle lies before you in all 
     its glory..." The player may, after all, be leaving the castle, in which 
     case it would not be before them, but behind, making the description 
     unreal.

     Movement Bias: when writing a description, don't say "You are walking on a
     path" because you never know, the player could be flying, levitating, 
     slithering, crawling, stomping, or anything in between.  

     Time and Season Bias: when writing a description, don't say "The sun 
     shines powerfully through the window" unless you can swap day descs for 
     night ones. At night, that desc is still the same, so the sun shouldn't be
     shining.  Seasonally, the leaves on a tree should not appear autumn reds, 
     browns, and yellows unless you can make that description only show during 
     that season.

SUGGESTIONS

   I have been MUDding for many years, I then became a builder, then an 
immortal, then an imp, and finally a coder. I am writing this because I 
am tired of seeing the same problems with the majority of newbie builders.
First of all I'd like to say that while building can be fun it is also 
hard work, a lot of people who have never built do not seem to realize it.
I have taught numerous people how to build. They start on one small area 
usually 50 rooms or less, they are all excited and gung-ho and get off to a 
good start but then somewhere along the line they realize: "hey, building is 
not as glamorous as I thought, it doesn't pay, and it is actually very hard 
work." 
   Then they quit, which I respect more than the ones who I teach how to build,
give them an area, and they sit around making a "special room for themselves" 
or take advantage of the builder commands and equip themselves to the hilt or 
they sit around and complain because they are not promoted in the first week. I 
do not ask for much from builders, I let them build anything they want, if 
there is something special they want that is not in the code we will put it in 
(as long as it is reasonable of course) I don't ask for long hours and I don't 
sit looking over anyone's shoulders, I don't even require a builder to have 
experience, I am more than willing to teach someone, what I am unwilling to do 
is let someone take advantage of me or my MUD which is mostly what I find 
happening with newbie builders. I know I am rambling and I assure you I do 
have a point and here it is: *drum roll please*
   Building is hard work! It is a form of expression and creativity.  What kind
of areas you build generally reflects on what kind of person you are.  You 
do not have to be a good speller but you do need a good dictionary/thesaurus.  
@RHELP M-W@n.  Sometimes building can seem like a thankless job and sometimes 
building can be a reward in itself.  Building a few areas, even a few good 
ones, does not make you an Immortal or an Imp.  It takes more than building to 
be one of those and it entails even more work.  Respect others and they will 
respect you. The more detailed an area the better it is. Always choose Quality 
over Quantity.  Put some pride in your areas, develop a style of your own.  Try
new things keep it interesting, if you become bored with building an area take 
a break and play a mortal or do something else, don't take advantage of builder
privileges.  Treat others as you wish to be treated. One more warning I would 
give to builders before they take things personally or get insulted.  Everyone 
has their own ideas on how to run a MUD, what it comes down to is whoever owns 
the MUD makes the final decision, so it does not matter how good you think your
idea is, it may never be used if the owner does not like it.  Plain and simple.
You see this on every MUD.  So please keep the ideas coming, but do not try to 
force them onto anyone.  Be constructive, not critical about peoples ideas.  
Everyone is allowed their opinions.    
Be original, finish what you start, have fun, and don't forget to breathe!

SWORDS

   This help file is designed to remove a few misconceptions concerning swords 
and swordplay of ages past.  The undertaking will be to discuss what a sword 
actually is and is not.  As we think of them today, the blade of the sword is 
constructed from a varying combination of iron and carbon.  When considering 
the material to make a blade from, there are two main factors that should come 
to mind.  The first factor is toughness, as in how resistant the metal is to 
change in shape.  This factor allows to blade to take and hold a good edge.  
The problem with a metal that is excessively tough is that it has a tendency to 
be brittle, meaning that when struck tiny pieces of the material break off, or
even have the sword snap.  
   The next property is the material's resilience or flex.  This is the 
opposite of toughness in that a material with high flex won't snap and chip.  
The problem with a material with excessive flex is that it will dent easily 
and can bend if enough pressure is applied to the blade.  It is the job of the 
blade smith to find a material with the best combination of toughness and flex 
so the sword withstands the test of time and battle.  I pointed out this fact 
to show how some "modern" materials are not good for making swords no matter 
how good they seem to be.  An example of such material is diamond which is the 
toughest material on earth but is extremely brittle so it would not be good to 
use as a sword blade.  Carbon steel is still the best material to make a sword 
from, however there are still many kinds of carbon steel.  The ratio of iron 
and carbon in the material determines how tough or flexible it will be.  
   A few other misconceptions about swords that are almost universal: 
   One is the mass of such weapons as the claymore and other large blades.  
In recorded history, there is no sword that was ever intended for use in 
battle that weighed over 11 pounds.  Claymores were generally 6 to 8 pounds.  
For some reason it is thought that knights lugged around 50 pound whoppers that 
were a foot thick and other such nonsense. Something people also are not quite 
correct about is the ability of swords to easily cut through hard materials 
such as wood and metal.  A sword will not chop down a large tree in one stroke 
or split an anvil, but it will do a great deal of damage to flesh and bone even 
if the victim is wearing armor.  
   
   Finally, if you would like to know any more about historical swords, contact
Shamra or visit the international sword forum at http://forums.swordforum.com.

SYSLOG SYSLOG-OFF LOGS SYSLOG-BRIEF SYSLOG-NORMAL NORMAL SYSLOG-COMPLETE AUTOLOG 

Usage: toggle syslog [ Off | Brief | Normal | On ]

The SYSLOG command controls how detailed of an on-line system log you see.
Messages surrounded by '[' and ']' are syslog messages and are in green
if you have color on.

The messages you receive are level dependent.

Examples:
 > toggle syslog on       - You will see all logs, spammy.
 > toggle syslog normal   - You will see all the important stuff.
 > toggle syslog brief    - You will see few logs.
 > toggle syslog off      - You will see no logs.
 > toggle syslog          - lets you know what your current setting is.

TBA TBAMUD PROJECT BACKGROUND STORY HISTORY INTRODUCTION ACADEMY COMMUNITY OVERVIEW VISION TBA-VISION

TBA stands for The Builder Academy. 
@RGOTO 3@n to enter the Builder Academy tutorial.

The Builder Academy (TBA) was created in October of 2000 on the MUD Cruel World. It began
with a combination of my own MUDding experience and the work of numerous others from the
MUDding community and evolved into an extensive tutorial zone, help files, and examples.


TBA now has two main missions. It originally was meant to be a training MUD open to anyone
willing to learn or teach how to create your own text-based World. 1,000's of builder's have
gone through our training and many MUDs require new builders to complete training at TBA before
they can apply to their MUD. TBA's other mission is the development of the codebase formerly
known as CircleMUD. Due to CircleMUD's stagnation TBA staff decided to release our codebase under
the name tbaMUD and we have been updating it tirelessly for over 10 years.

TBA is a low stress, no deadline, training environment where anyone with motivation can work at
their own pace to learn as much or as little as they wish. Numerous people are available to answer
questions and give advice.

1000's of builders served and counting.

The most challenging aspect of running a MUD is finding good builders. You will hear this from the
admin of every MUD that has ever been. In the past it has always been up to each individual MUD to
find and usually train their own builders. This works, but I think the MUDding community can come up
with something better. That is why we created The Builder's Academy. No pressure, no deadline, just
come and learn or help teach. Give something back to the community we have all taken so much from.
TBA is a MUDding community resource, please submit any lessons learned or building tips and tricks
so we can improve our codebase and training.

TBA can also be used by other MUDs as a builder's port. Just send us your newbie builders. We will
teach them and then you can have them back with the zones they built.

We are always open to anyone willing to learn or help teach so we can continue to improve the tbaMUD
codebase.

Help and World files are the "master" versions. Before a release I copy the help file and World files to /tbamud
Only difference from stock is do_cheat, help files viewable by any level, do_advance is LVL_GOD, and 600+ zones.
tbamud.com is the latest Joomla version with Kunena as our forums. Download section is Google Drive.
Builder Applications can be viewed here: goo.gl/0FBsys
Backups are done monthly of /tba and using the Akeeba component in Joomla, I keep an archive. Github is our version control system but I like backups of backups. Please do reasonable backups of your own.

commands.

TEXT-EDITOR TEXTEDITOR /d /i /h /s /a /c /ra /l /fi /d1 /p WORDWRAP WORD-WRAP FORMATTING REPLACE /e# DELETE-LINE REMOVE-LINE LINES INDENT

   The text editor is what you use to write room/mob/obj/extra descriptions,
mudmails, and even boards. It allows you more commands than the typical entry.
To learn the commands while using the text editor, type /h. It will tell you
what all the / commands do. Always use /fi to format, indent, and word wrap.
It looks much better to see writing that is formatted than one that runs all
over the place wrapping around etc. Just simply type /fi on a new line and hit
enter. Before you save type /l to list the buffer and see for yourself how it
looks. Fix as needed.
   When entering the text editor for the first time make sure to use /c to clear
the current contents. Indent and format all descriptions by typing /fi (format
with indent) in the text editor.  This includes all forms of OLC, mudmails,
boards, and anywhere else you use the text editor. This will indent the line
by 3 spaces and wrap your text at less than 80 characters so telnet users can
read it.
 
Editor command formats: /<letter>
 
@n/t         -  converts @* color codes into color. Use prior to /s.
@n/a         -  aborts the editor and changes are lost.
@n/c         -  clears the buffer.
@n/d#        -  deletes line #, or a range #-#.
@n/e# <text> -  changes the line at # with <text>.
@n/f         -  formats text. 
@n/fi        -  indented formatting of text (highly recommended for all desc's).
                paragraphs can be formatted by /f 1-4 (first from lines 1-4, 
                and /f 5-9 (second from lines 5-9).
@n/h         -  list text editor commands.
@n/i# <text> -  inserts <text> before line #.
@n/l         -  lists buffer.
@n/n         -  lists buffer with line numbers, or a range #-#.
@n/r 'a' 'b' -  replace 1st occurence of text <a> in buffer with text.
@n/ra 'a' 'b'-  replace all occurences of text <a> within buffer with text.
                usage: /ra 'pattern' 'replacement'
@n/s         -  saves the text and exits the editor.

NOTE: /f and /fi in trigedit will auto indent your trigger. PLEASE USE IT.

Commands such as /r, /n, /e#, /i#, /d# are invaluable and will make your job
much easier. For example, say you mistype "the" with "teh" in a 10 line
description. Instead of /c (clearing) the text you can /r 'teh' 'the' or if it
was on line 5 you can type /e5 <line with teh spelled correctly> or /d5. Learn
all these options.

Warning: Some clients will give you problems since they use special characters 
like the / character (MUDMaster 2k, Avplay, Mush, and SimpleMU).

THE-MUD-CONNECTOR TMC MUD-CONNECTOR MUDCONNECTOR

   Most of our traffic comes through word of mouth or TMC reviews. If you are so
inclined please leave a review about your experience with TBA at:
http://mudconnector.com/mud-bin/adv_search.cgi?Mode=MUD&mud=The+Builder+Academy

   The most challenging aspect of running a mud is finding good 
builders. You will hear this from the admin of every MUD that has ever
been. In the past it has always been up to each individual MUD to find
and usually train their own builders. This works, but I think the 
MUDding community can come up with something better. That is why I 
created The Builder Academy.

   We have been open to anyone interested in learning or teaching how
to build using Oasis OLC with dg scripts since 2000. TBA has expanded
to also be used to develop stock zones for CircleMUD.

   TBA has trained 1000's of builders and has an extensive tutorial 
and help file system. No pressure, no deadline, just come learn, 
teach, or help develop CircleMUD. Give back to the community we have
all taken so much from. TBA is a MUDding resource. Take advantage of
it so we can improve the entire MUDding community. 

   TBA can also be used by other MUDs as a builder's port. Just send 
us your newbie builders. We will teach them and then you can have 
them back with the zones they built.

   We are always open to anyone willing to learn, teach, or help 
develop our newly released tbaMUD codebase (the codebase formerly 
known as CircleMUD).

THEMES

   The theme for an area is its reason to be.  A theme can be simple. Like, a
homeland of a few loose-knit families of storm giants. Or, a part of the sea
where a merchant ship from Anon is engaged in battle with a pirate ship. 
Themes can, and should be elaborate and include insight into the history of 
the zone, how its society and economy work, current plots or conflicts going 
on in the area, and how other people in the world view the place. The more 
work you put into the theme the better it will be, and the better other areas 
will be that build off of it. Discuss your ideas and concepts with others to 
help develop them to their fullest.
   Zones should be well fleshed out stories that catch the visitors attention 
and bring out their curiosity, making them want to stay for more. The 
descriptions should be well fleshed out, bringing images into the players 
minds, and there should be challenges and tricks that the player will not 
expect.
   Try and build a mini quest into part of your area so that characters can 
do something active rather than feel like aggressive tourists.  If you are 
building a wilderness area, perhaps include some kind of hidden/trapped 
treasure one can find. If you are building a populated area, think about 
having some mystery that a player can uncover. Built-in quests make a good 
area great.    
   Another way to make an area interesting is to create some sort of plot line
for it, or a coherent theme, rather than a collection of haphazardly related
rooms.  The plot can be complex like infiltrating a castle to garner the war
plans of the evil Lord Zygol, or simple like ridding the caves of goblins, or
anything in between.  Often the plot in an area can be advanced by some fairly
simple puzzles or descriptions.  This can be done with the help of triggers.
   TBA allows you to build anything you would like. Themes could include:
sci-fi, futuristic, medieval, present day, ancient history, Jurassic, western,
Chinese dynasty, etc.

THIEF THIEVES

Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class offers.
Their specialty tends to be in the darker, sneakier art.  Many of these
qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as picking locks.

You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to thieves: sneak, hide, steal, backstab, pick lock, track

See the help on each skill for more information.

TILDES ~

On tbaMUD a tilde is used in the world files to denote an end of line. This way
the files can be saved and read. Because of this adding a tilde in any of the 
editors on older versions of CircleMUD could make the MUD unbootable.

#31
TIME TICKS

Usage: time

Gives you the current game time. tbaMUD uses zulu time 0-24 hours. There are
75 seconds per hour, 35 days per month, and 17 months per year. 1 MUD year 
takes about 12 days.

/** Number of real life seconds per mud hour.
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_HOUR       75
/** Real life seconds in one mud day.
 * Current calculation = 30 real life minutes. */
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_DAY        (24*SECS_PER_MUD_HOUR)
/** Real life seconds per mud month.
 * Current calculation = 17.5 real life hours */
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_MONTH      (35*SECS_PER_MUD_DAY)
/** Real life seconds per mud month.
 * Current calculation ~= 12.4 real life days */
@#define SECS_PER_MUD_YEAR       (17*SECS_PER_MUD_MONTH)
 
/* real-life time (remember Real Life?) */
@n#define SECS_PER_REAL_MIN       60
@n#define SECS_PER_REAL_HOUR      (60*SECS_PER_REAL_MIN)
@n#define SECS_PER_REAL_DAY       (24*SECS_PER_REAL_HOUR)
@n#define SECS_PER_REAL_YEAR      (365*SECS_PER_REAL_DAY)

#31
TITLES

Usage: title <new title>

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the ( and ) characters) because those
are reserved for flags.

Do not create offensive titles or your title will be set for you.

See also: FLAGS, WHO, NOTITLE
#0
TLIST TRIGLIST TRIG-LIST TRIGEDIT-LIST TRIGGERLIST TRIGGER-LIST

Usage: tlist <range of vnums or zone number>

Tlist gives you a list of the triggers numbered within the parameters.
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could
have made them. Examples of zones with good triggers include:
Zones: 0, 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 19, 27, 118 to name a few. 

   tlist 13          - lists all triggers defined in zone 13
   tlist 4000 4099   - lists all existing triggers from vnum 4000 to 4099

Usage: toggle
       toggle <option> <argument>

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command can also be used to change these values, if used with the correct
argument. When a toggle is set, it will be saved in that state until the next
time you change it. Level IMP toggle includes:

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the MUD.
This command can also be used to change these values, if used with the correct
argument. When a toggle is set, it will be saved in that state until the next
time you change it.

TRIAL-ROOM TRIAL-VNUM TRIALVNUM INTRO TRIALROOM TRIALS TRAILROOM APPROVAL VNUM-APPROVAL TRAIL-VNUM TESTROOMS WIZNUMBER TRAINING-VNUM TEST-ROOM TRAIL-ROOM TRAILROOM AUTHORIZE

   During your initial training you will be able to edit a single trial Vnum.
@RHELP VIRTUAL-NUMBER@n. As you learn the different building commands feel free
to goto <your Vnum> and test them out. Your Vnum (look at your title to see 
what Vnum you were assigned) includes your trial room/mob/object. For example, 
if your title says: Rumble has trial Vnum 13900, this means I will make one 
room, one mob, and one object by editing that Vnum (i.e. redit 13900). Both the 
mob and object must load in the room through zedit. Do not make a shop, quest, 
or trigger with your Vnum, those are more advanced and should only be attempted
when the first four forms of OLC are well understood. Your Trial Vnum must have 
your name in the room title.
   This one Vnum is your chance to show off your building abilities. Every 
builder makes one room/mob/obj here. It is also a chance for you to learn and 
improve your building before being assigned a zone. Be creative. Make something 
impressive and unique, not another "Ultimate Weapon" or "invincible mob" with 
every affection and stat possible. They have already been made and impress 
nobody. By monitoring this one trial Vnum the trainers can catch most of your 
mistakes and prevent you from repeating them throughout an entire zone. Once 
you finish your one room/mob/obj you must have it checked for any errors. Ask 
any God or above to do this for you. Once all errors are corrected and 
you have proven you know the basics of building you can submit a zone proposal. 
@RHELP PROPOSAL@n for more information. Once your proposal is approved you will 
be assigned your own zone, consisting of 100 Vnum's. If you have not been 
assigned a Vnum or zone please be patient and mudmail Rumble. Once you are 
assigned either of these do not remove them from your title. Your title should 
always have your trial vnum or your zone somewhere in it.

#31
TRIG-ATTACH %ATTACH% DG_ATTACH TRIG_ATTACH

Usage: attach vnum id
* This small trigger will attach a trigger to the carrier this can for instance 
* be used if you want the mob to change attitude by adding another trigger 
* (ie - mob was mad - mob got apple - mob gets a 'nicer' trigger attached
attach 3001 %self.id% 

   This command allows a trigger to attach a trigger (referenced by vnum) to 
anything capable of receiving triggers, by id number. (%self.id%, %object.id%, 
and %actor.id% are examples of id numbers, for use with this command.)

Example: @RTSTAT 1345@n

See also: ATTACH, DETACH, TRIG-DETACH
#31
TRIG-DETACH %DETACH%

Usage: detach <vnum | all> id
* if we - as described in the attach example, want our mob/obj/room to behave
* differently, it is not always enough to just add another trigger with attach.
* it might be necessary to remove some old ones :
detach 3000 %self.id%
or
detach all %self.id%

   The opposite of attach, this removes triggers from the specified target.

#31
TRIG-RETURN RETURN-0 CONTINUE %RETURN% RETURN-1
 
Usage: return 0

   Return 0 in a trigger will allow certain triggers added flexibility. This 
is dependent on the trigger type and is explained in each trigger help file under
@RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n. The only way to make two triggers of the same type to both 
fire is to have the first one return 0. Other Examples:

Get, Give, Drop, Wear, Leave, and Consume trigs with return 0 prevents the action.
Command trigs with return 0 allow the command to continue to the MUD and not be
stopped by the trigger.

Return does not end the triggers execution. It is returned after all commands have
been executed, or a wait or halt command is called.

Return 1 is rarely used since it just means normal termination of the trigger.

Example: @RTSTAT 25, 13F@n

See also: TRIG-TYPE, HALT, WAIT
#31
TRIG-SET %SET% MSET

Usage: set <variable> <value>

Set creates a variable without evaluating it. For example:
  set foobar 15 - 5
Sets the variable foobar to the string "15 - 5"

* this example sets the value of result to '%self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp%'
set result %self.hitp% * 100 / %self.maxhitp% 
* The %result% var now works as a 'function' every time it is accessed.
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%
%damage% %self% 30
say My hitpoint percentage is %result%

   The set command is used to set (or create) the specified variable equal to 
the provided expression, which will be evaluated when the variable is accessed. 
There also exists an "eval" command, with the same syntax. Eval differs in that 
the expression is evaluated immediately.

Example: @RTSTAT 49, 41005@n

#31
TRIG-STATISTICS TRIGEDIT-STATISTICS TRIG-STATS %ACTOR.STR% %ACTOR.INT% STRADD 

Trig Usage: %actor.<stat>(<#>)%
            %actor.str% returns the value
            %actor.str(18) sets it to 18

Checks the actor's stat. A number in the subfield sets.
Stats include: cha, con, dex, int, str, stradd (only if str is 18).

See also: STATS
#31
TRIG-SWITCH TRIGEDIT-SWITCH CASE TRIG-CASE DEFAULT BREAK %SWITCH% 

Usage: 
    
switch %random.3%
  case 1
    %echo% This case has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
  case 2
    %echo% This case has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
  default
    %echo% default case covers any unmatched cases. In this case 3
@%echo% so it also has a 33% (1 in 3) chance of firing.
  break
done

   Switch evaluates an expression and looks for a match amongst the case 
statements that follow. If none of the following case statements are a match, 
and a default statement exists, the default statement is considered a match. 
If a match is found, the commands that follow it, up until a break or done 
command, are executed. 

Break is used to terminate commands in a switch or to stop a loop @RHELP WHILE@n. 
Case is used to begin a new conditional group in a switch block.
Default is similar to case but matches any condition not met. 
Done is used to terminate a while or switch block.

TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-EXAMPLES

To add life to the worlds tbaMUD uses something called triggers. There are 
three things in game that can have triggers attached to them: mobiles, objects,
and rooms. Examples of common triggers include:

Cityguards screaming 'PROTECT THE INNOCENT! BANZAI! CHARGE!', (a mob trigger).
A portal that teleports players when they enter it (an object trigger).
A room that creates a new exit when a player pulls a lever (a room trigger).

Every room, mobile, and object can have one or multiple triggers attached to it.
These triggers are activated by an event such as room entry, speech, commands,
etc. 

There are several different types of triggers. Each trigger type determines
when the trigger will be checked. For example, a mob speech trigger is checked
every time a character who is in the same room as the mob with the trigger uses
the 'say' command. A room enter trigger is checked every time a character
enters the room. There are two parts of the trigger used to determine if the
trigger's commands are executed when it is checked, the argument and numerical
argument (NArg). Some triggers use both; some may use only one of the two; and
some may use neither. The interpretation of these two fields is dependant on
the type, and is described in more detail with each triggers help file. @RHELP
TRIG-TYPE@n for a listing of all the trigger type help files.

When an event in the game occurs, each trigger in the room where the event 
occurred is checked to see if there are any triggers which are supposed to
react to that event. Only one trigger of each trigger will be run by a single
event. For example, if there are two triggers on a trigger, and both are the
same type with the same arguments, the second trigger will only be run if the
first one is already running. 

Triggers can be of more than one type. For example, to simulate a cursed item,
a trigger on the object could be of types drop, give, and remove. A more common
combined trigger would have both random and global types, so the random trigger
would be checked even when the zone was empty. Combined triggers must have the
same argument and numerical argument. 

The other component of a trigger is the command list. This is a series of
commands that are executed when the trigger is run. Commands are chosen from
two groups of commands, trigger specific commands and game commands. Triggers
specific commands are those commands that only the trigger interpreter can
recognize. These include flow control commands (such as if, elseif, else, end,
halt, wait, and return), and commands to manipulate variables (such as set,
eval, unset, and global). Game commands are those commands that a player could
issue from their command line as well as special commands added for mobiles,
objects, and rooms such as wake, east, sit, etc.

#31
TRIGEDIT-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL TRIG-ADVANCED-TUTORIAL 

If you haven't already refer to @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL@n. The process is
the same:
   1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.
   2. Make the mobs, objects, and rooms.
   3. Split up the quest into simple sections.
   4. Decide what trigger types you need.
   5. Write the triggers.
   6. Attach the triggers - permanently
   7. Done ? 

Decide what you want the trigger to do. 
   First determine the type of trigger you want: Room, Mobile, or Object.
Then decide what action you want to activate the trigger. Doing this before
worrying what can be done prevents you from limiting yourself to what you have
seen other triggers do, and allows you to produce a more interesting trigger. 
  
For this example, I want to create a gate guard for a small walled town. The 
ruler of the town has decided that each group of people will be charged ten 
coins to enter his domain. The gate guard must notify travelers of the cost to 
enter, collect the money, allow people who have paid to enter the city, and 
close the gate after them. This will be a mob trigger. 
  
Make the mobs, objects, and rooms.
Split up the quest into simple sections.
Decide what trigger types you need. @RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n  
   Our gate guard needs to react to four different events. These events are what
will cause the triggers to fire. Remember: a trigger requires a "triggering" 
action. i.e. speech, command, greet, etc.

1. A character entering the room from the south needs to be told the price for 
   entrance. This will be a mobile greet trigger. @RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET@n 
2. When the guard is given ten or more coins, the guard must open the gate. This
   is done by a mobile bribe trigger. @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-BRIBE@n I also want 
   the guard to give change and refuse entry for those without the money. 
3. When someone passes through the gate, the guard must close and lock the gate 
   behind them. This is done with a mobile act trigger. @RHELP TRIG-MOB-ACT@n 
4. When the gate is opened from the other side, the guard must eventually close
   it. This will be another act trigger. 

Determine the arguments and the numerical arguments of the triggers from the help
files. For the bribe trigger, the guard must respond whenever someone gives him
some coins, so Numeric Arg should be 1. The Act triggers should fire off "leaves
north" and "the gate is opened from the other side."
  
Write the body of the trigger.
This is the most complex and time consuming part. The valid commands and
variables are explained in the help files @RHELP TRIG-COMMANDS@n and @RHELP 
VARIABLES@n. Expressions are also used: @RHELP EXPRESSIONS@n 

For the greet trigger, I want the guard to inform anyone entering from the
south how to get into the city. First, I must check if the character is
entering from the south. If they are then the guard should tell the actor the
cost of entry. @RTSTAT 4@n
 
Under @RHELP TRIG-MOB-GREET@n we see that the variable %direction% is set to
the direction that the character entered. The percent signs around any word 
means it is a variable and it can be found in @RHELP VARIABLES@n. The two equal 
signs together compares the value of the variable to the word "south" if these
are equal the lines in the body of the if will be executed. The "wait 1 sec"
pauses the trigger for 1 second to allow the character to enter the room. (The 
greet trigger is actually checked before the character enters the room. After
another brief pause, the guard announces the cost to enter the town. The
indentations are not needed, but make it easier to read. You can auto-indent a
trigger by using /f or /fi. This is HIGHLY encouraged. Remember, every if needs
an end!

The guard must open the gate if ten or more coins were given to him. @RTSTAT 5@n
After a brief wait (so everything doesn't happen at once), the guard unlocks
the gate and opens it. The guard will close the gate after 10 seconds, even if
no one passes through it. For the line "give %amount% coins %actor.name%", the 
variables amount and actor are both set when the bribe trigger is called, these 
variables are automatically substituted.

For the first act trigger, I want the guard to close and lock the gate after
someone passes through the gate. The guard should wait briefly so he isn't
shutting the gate on the character's back, then close and lock the gate. @RTSTAT 7@n
  
For the last act trigger we want the guard to close and lock the gate when it 
is opened from the other side. @RTSTAT 8@n  The "wait 5 sec" gives time for 
someone on the other side to get through the gate. Next decide the order of the 
triggers. The triggers are checked from first to last. If there are two 
triggers of the same type, the first one run will be the only one run. 

There are is one set of triggers which are the same type, the act triggers. 
Since both have arguments that will not occur together the order does not 
matter. 

Write the trigger.
Simply use trigedit to create your trigger and they will be auto-saved for you
when you exit the editor. @RHELP TRIGEDIT@n, @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MENU@n for help

Attach the triggers.
In the OasisOLC medit, redit, oedit menus, use menu option S to enter the
trigger menu. Then select the triggers that will be part of your trigger. Note,
that order is important! If there are two possible triggers that could both be
executed at the same time, only the first one found in the list will be
activated. In this example. If you require two of the same trigger types to work
you must use a return 0. @RHELP RETURN-0@n

Test the trigger.
You should see how the trigger actually works in the game, and watch other
people interact with it. Often you will see ways you can improve it. 

@RGOTO 13@n and work your way north to test these out. Triggers 4, 5, 7, 8

TRIGEDIT-ARRAYS ARRAYS TRIG-ARRAYS

   Trigedit can use arrays to store information. An array is a variable that 
can hold more than one piece of information at a time. Arrays are used to store
a list of variables.

For Example:   set  textarray[1] a string of text.
Would store "a string of text." in textarray position 1. You can have numerous
positions to an array. See the examples below.

This is often called the 'trigger', and is actually a small program, executed 
step by step. In it, you can use different types of commands: trigger - specific 
commands, flow control commands - if this is a mobile trigger, you can use 
standard mud commands like say or give.

TRIGEDIT-MOB-TUTORIAL TRIGEDIT-TUTORIAL MOB-TUTORIAL 

This mini-quest is setup in TBA as an example. @RGOTO 13@n and work your way 
north with nohassle off. Be sure you know how to use the @RTSTAT@n and @RSTAT@n 
commands.
 
The following 7 steps should give you a general idea about what to do, and how 
to go about making small quests with trigedit. This example concentrates on 
quests involving mobs. 

The process can be broken down to the following:  
   1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.
   2. Make corresponding mobs, objects, and rooms.
   3. Split up the quest into simple sections.
   4. Decide which trigger types you need.
   5. Write the triggers.
   6. Attach the triggers - permanently
   7. Done ? 
   
1. Decide what you want the trigger to do.  
   In this example, we want to make a small mini quest in an area. The quest 
will work like this: When you enter the room with the questmaster it will start
to tell a tale. In this tale, you are instructed to perform a task. In this 
case kill an ogre that lives nearby. As proof of the kill, you must bring back 
the ogre's wings and give them to the questmaster. 

2. Make corresponding objects and mobs.  
      1 Questgiver mob - I've chosen 'the questmaster' - vnum 14
      1 Target mob - In this case 'a quest ogre' - vnum 16
      1 Quest object - 'a pair of wings' - vnum 14 

3. Split up the quest.  
   Next thing to do is look at the different steps involved with the quest. In 
this example, we have three steps: 
   Player entering room -> tell story 
   Player finds and kills ogre -> load object
   Player gives questmaster the wings -> reward player 

4. Find corresponding trigger types.  
   Having split the quest up it makes it easy to decide which triggers to use 
from @RHELP TRIG-TYPE@n:
   mob GREET trigger (attached to questmaster) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-GREET@n
   mob DEATH trigger (attached to ogre) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-DEATH@n
   mob RECEIVE trigger (attached to questmaster) @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MOB-RECEIVE@n
 
5. Write the triggers.  
    Up to this point trigedit should not have been used. Most people struggle
with triggers because they have not planned what they want to happen or do not
know what trigedit is capable of. Read the help files of each type and ask for
help if you need it. Remember, most of the work required with triggers is 
planning! You must know exactly what you want to do before you do it. Now that
we know exactly what we want to do we can use trigedit.

Trigger Editor [1]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example Quest Offer - 14@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yGreet @n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* we don't want him to tell this to mobs. Check if actor is a player.
if %actor.is_pc%
  * only greet players coming from the south.
  if %direction% == south
    * wait 1 second, always give the player time before you start sending text.
    wait 1 sec
    say Can you help me, %actor.name%?
    wait 1 sec
    say An ogre has something of mine.
    wait 1 sec
    say If you slay him I'll give you all the coins I can spare.
    wait 1 sec
    say Please, bring me the wings he has stolen.
  end
end@n

The trigger above will fire when a player enters the room from the south. If a
mobile enters the if check at the beginning will be false and the trigger will
not execute. Note how I named the trigger. ALWAYS include the VNUM of where you 
plan on attaching the trigger. Also, give it a name so it is easy to understand
where it is used. Now for the second trigger:

2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yDeath@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@csay you got the best of me %actor.name%.
* load the wings
%load% obj 1
* reload the mob for the next questor
%load% mob 16@n

The above trigger will be executed when the mob is killed - just before the 
death cry. The last trigger just needs to check if the object handed over is 
the correct one. Let's see it, here with vnum 2: 

> trigedit 3
Trigger Editor [3]

1) Name         : @yMob Tutorial Example Completion - 14@n
2) Intended for : @yMobiles@n
3) Trigger types: @yReceive@n
4) Numeric Arg : @y100@n
5) Arguments    : 
6) Commands:
@c* check if this was indeed the right object
if %object.vnum% == 1
  wait 1 sec
  say Thank you, %actor.name%
  %send% %actor% %self.name% gives you a gold piece.
  %echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% is rewarded for his valor.
  nop %actor.gold(1)%
  wait 5 sec
  %purge% obj 1
else
  * this wasn't the right object - don't accept it
  say I don't want that - bring me back my wings.
  return 0
end@n

First check if the object is the correct vnum, then give the reward, and send 
messages to the player and others in the room. If it wasn't the object, reject 
it, and use return 0 to prevent the object from leaving the players inventory. 
Lastly, and very importantly, 'end' the if. Every if must have an end.

6. Attach the triggers - permanently  
   Proceed and add the triggers to the two mobiles through medit: 

> medit 14
[medit menu]
Enter choice ? S
     Script Editor

     Trigger List:
     <none>

 N)  New trigger for this script
 D)  Delete a trigger in this script
 X)  Exit Script Editor

     Enter choice :
Here, add the scripts by typing N, then the trigger vnum: 
Enter choice : n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 1
Enter choice ? n
Please enter position, vnum   (ex: 1, 200): 3
Enter choice ? x

And add the trigger (vnum 2) to the ogre (vnum 16) in a similar manner. 

7. Done ?  
   The triggers are now attached to the correct mobs, and the players of your 
mud can now take the quest whenever they wish. This is a great time for 
considering improvements to the little quest: 

Balance issues: 
   Should players get a smaller reward if they perform the quest many times ? 
   Should it be limited to 1 quest per player or 1 per reboot ? 
Gameplay issues: 
   Perhaps other mobs in town should tell the player to go see the questmaster ? 
   Should the ogre always load the object, or only when people know he has it ? 
   Are there other mobs who would like to pay for that object ? 

The above list is just a few examples. All of them could be implemented, but 
it is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

TRIGEDIT-NAMES TRIG-NAMES TRIGGER-NAMES

1) Name         : @ynew trigger@n

   Always use names that explain your trigger and include the VNUM for the 
mob/obj/room that the trigger is going to be attached to.  It is important to 
give your trigger a name you and others can understand.  This way others can 
search "vnum trig <keyword>."  This will also make it easier when using 
tlist and tstat, allowing others to quickly comprehend what the trigger does.
Here are some good examples:

Princess Shout for Help - M2229     --> Trigger 2204 attached to mob 2229.
Tutorial Example Quest Offer - M14  --> Trigger 1 attached to mob 14.
No Recall - R10                      --> Trigger 1201 attached to room 10.

TRIGEDIT-TRIGGER-TYPES

3) Trigger types: @yGreet@n
This is a bitvector  of which kind of events this trigger is triggered by. This 
is the most important part of the trigger. It is here you decide if you want the 
trigger to react on people dying in the room, dropping objects, saying stuff, 
entering, jumping insanely up and down or whatever else you might think of.

This part is also the most important, in the sense that the rest of the triggers' 
info means different things, depending on what trigger type the trigger has.

TRIGEDIT-VARIABLES VARIABLES TRIG-VARS TRIG-VARIABLES TRIGGER-VARIABLES VARS %VARIABLES% %VARIABLE% %% %TRIGGER% %TRIGGERS% %COMMAND% %WORD% VARIABLES-REFERENCE REFERENCES %VAR% DG-VARIABLES TRIGEDIT-VARS %VARIABLE%

Variables appear as a name surrounded by '%'s, such as %actor% 

Before a command is processed, the line is scanned and any variables are
replaced. First the list of local variables are checked to see if the variable
is there. If not, the global variables are checked. A proper global match must
have a zero context or the current context of the trigger. (When a trigger starts
running, its context is 0. The trigger context command may be used to change
context.) If a match is still not found, a list of 'built in' variables (ones
not declared by the trigger) are checked. If no match is found, the variable is
replaced with an empty string (the variable is removed from the line, and
nothing added in its place).

There are two types of variables, local and global. All local variables are
deleted when a trigger finishes executing, and can only be used by the trigger.
Global variables remain until removed with unset, the MUD is rebooted, or the 
trigger is removed. 

Global variables also have a context associated with them. By default, the
context is 0. Any global being referenced with a context of zero will be seen.
Through the 'context <value>' command, a trigger may set its context to any
integer; Globals created are always assigned the current trigger context. When a
global is referenced, if its context is not 0 or the current context of the
trigger, it will not be seen. This technique allows, among other things, arrays
of globals to be created by using a series of contexts as indexes. Also, it
allows globals to be associated with a specific character, room, or object in
the game, by using the id of the target as the context. 

Variable Fields 

A field of a variable can also be retrieved, based on their type. To get a 
field, a notation of %variable.field% is used. The valid fields are listed in 
the help files below. 

@RCHAR-VAR@n - Variables for characters.    @RTSTAT 27@n
@ROBJ-VAR@n  - Variables for objects.       @RTSTAT 28@n

TRIGGER-EDITORS

A trigger consists of the type, information on when to execute it, a list of
commands, and a list of variables. Each mobile, object, and room have their 
own set of triggers.

TRIGGER-TESTING TRIGEDIT-TESTING
 
There are numerous reasons a trigger may not fire.
 
1. Nohassle - Ensure you have nohassle off. Simply toggle it by typing "nohassle" 
or stat self to see if the PRF flag NO_HASS is set (enabled).
 
2. %echo% - Make sure the trigger is doing what you expect. Add an "%echo% firing" 
in the first line to make sure it is working. Also echo any variables you are 
using in the trigger to make sure they contain what you expect.
 
3. Mobs - If a mob can not see the player a trigger may not fire. Be wary of blind
mobs, dark rooms, invis/sneaking players. Also switch into the mob to test the 
trigger and you will see the mob try to execute the trigger commands to help you 
troubleshoot. If you see a "Huh?" or a "that person is not here" it can help fix 
your problem.
 
4. Command Triggers - Arguments: * means all commands. This is an easy way to 
freeze yourself (all commands you enter are captured by the trigger). To protect 
against this and other possibly malicious uses of triggers level 32 and above may 
not be able to fully test some triggers (specifically damage and command come to 
mind). So either create a mortal character or set your level to 31 to fully test 
all triggers. The return command can be setup to allow you to restore your level 
back to original, ask your coder to add your ID.

TSTAT EXAMPLES TRIGSTAT TRIGGERSTAT

Usage: tstat <trigger vnum>

Tstat lets you learn more about a specific trigger. 
Be warned that all the triggers on TBA may not work since anyone could have 
made them. Ask around for the best examples. Zone 0 are the basic examples. For 
more examples check out zones 0, 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 19, 27, 29, 30, 77, 236 and 
237. There are numerous others.  

To learn more about any of these just tlist <zone #> then tstat each
trigger individually. You can always ask Rumble to find you an example.

See also: TLIST, TRIGEDIT, OLC

Other Examples: TRIG-EXAMPLES 
#31
UNAFFECT

Usage: unaffect [target]

Removes all affections (i.e., spell effects) from a player.

#31
UNGROUP DISBAND

Usage: ungroup [group member]

UNGROUP can be used by group leaders to disband the entire group, or
to kick a specific group member out of the group (and stop him/her from
following the leader).

Examples:

  > ungroup
  > ungroup homer

See also: GROUP
#0
UNSET

Usage: unset <variable>

* in this example we have a var %testvar% we no longer need:

set testvar hops happily along
global testvar
%echo% %self.name% %testvar%
unset testvar

   Unset removes the variable from the global variables of this trigger, or if not 
found there, from the trigger.

Example: @RTSTAT 70@n

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS OBJ-WANDS STAVES

Usage: use <staff>
       use <wand> <Target>

   Using a staff will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a room,
except yourself. Therefore, staves are naturally very powerful and may be very
dangerous to use around other players so use them with caution.

Using wands requires that you point it at a target, which can be either a 
character (player) or an object.

   Please note: Both staffs and wands must be held in the hand prior to use! 
You must still supply the name of the staff or wand to avoid confusion.

USERS STATUS

Usage: users [switches]

USERS gives a list of all sockets (i.e., connections) currently active on the
MUD.  The multi-column display shows the socket number (used by DC), class,
level, and name of the player connected, connection state, idle time, and
hostname.

The following switches are available:

-k or -o   Show only outlaws (killers and thieves).
-p         Show only sockets in the playing sockets.
-d         Show only non-playing (deadweight) sockets.
-l min-max Show only sockets whose characters are from level min to max.
-n <name>  Show the socket with <name> associated with it.
-h <host>  Show all sockets from <host>.
-c list    Show only sockets whose characters' classes are in list.

VAREXISTS %VAREXISTS% %EXISTS% EXISTS

Usage: if %actor.varexists(on_quest_zone_1)%

  The above usage checks if the variable on_quest_zone_1 has been saved to the 
player file or to a mob (does not work for objects). It can also be used with 
!%actor.varexists(on_quest_zone_1)% to mean does not exist. This is useful on 
quests or other complex triggers that need to save variables to a player file 
by using remote.

VIRTUAL-NUMBERS RNUM  

    Each room, mob, object, shop, and trigger within a zone is given a unique
number called a Virtual Number or Vnum. These Vnums are independent, so there
can be both a room number 1300, an object 1300, a mob, a shop, and a trigger.
When defining and referencing parts of a zone builders always refers to each 
entity by its Vnum. Vnums are not seen by mortal players. Each zone also has 
a Vnum.  The zone Vnum for any zone is simply the room, mob, object, shop, or 
trigger Vnum divided by 100. For example, The Builder Academy is zone 13, 
consisting of Vnums 1300 to 1399.
   tbaMUD worlds are divided into distinct sections called zones.  Each
zone typically consists of a single region of the MUD's virtual world with a
consistent storyline.  Each zone can define its own rooms, mobs, objects,
shops, and triggers. A single zone typically contains 100 rooms, 100 mobs, 100
objects, 100 shops, and 100 triggers. 
   If I made the Sword of Cheezy Destruction, I may decide to make it object 
vnum 1300 of my zone.  The first two digits are the zone number of my area, 
the second two identify which item it is in that area. It would be zone 13, 
object 00 of 100 possible objects. However, never use any VNUM from someone
else's zone without the permission of that person and the staff.

       wait until <mudtime>
 
* This trigger gives the actor 10 seconds to get out.
say GET OUT! NOW!
wait 10 s
mkill %actor%
 
   The wait statement is used to 'pause' the trigger execution for a period of 
time. When a trigger is being activated it will execute all commands immediately. 
To create a pause during trigger execution use the wait command. A wait can
use seconds or cycles (1/20th of a second).
 
Example: @RTSTAT 103, 43, 79@n

Use these commands to change your position.  If you feel weary, it
is a good idea to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even sleep. A
player recovers hitpoints faster when resting or sleeping.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.  This makes
them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence and
fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.  However, they lack the
ability to use magic of any sort.

You can improve your skills by using the practice command.

Skills available to warriors: kick, rescue, track, bash

WATERWALK WATWALK 

Usage: cast 'waterwalk' [target]

   Enable yourself and others to traverse over water as if it was solid ground.

WEAPONS DAGGERS OEDIT-WEAPON

   When you create weapons, try to help round out the distribution of weapon
types. What I mean by this is that there are tons of swords already in the
game, but not that many pole arms or flails. You are probably going to get a
few groans from the immortals if you create yet another sword while neglecting
the other weapon types. No weapon may ever exceed 20 pounds in weight and do not
forget backstabbing is only possible with piercing weapons.
   So often builders always make the biggest and baddest weapons with little
consideration of reality. Before you make a weapon, think about who will be
using it, how much should it weigh, how much damage should it inflict. Use
common sense. A two-handed battleaxe should always do more damage than a 
dagger. Otherwise, why would I be a warrior and able to use large weapons if
I can be a thief and use a dagger that does more damage? Warriors should have
the best weapons. Mages should have the weakest. Weight is important enough
to mention again. A weight of 18, means only a player with strength 18 or up
can wield it, perfect to make weapons restricted to only warriors, and it also
makes a mage with the strength spell very important. Each race and class has
their advantages and disadvantages, use them.
   Some permanent effects such as sanctuary and armor should be reserved for
armor not weapons, basically weapons would most often benefit the wielder with
some sort of detection spell, not protection. Also remember that some classes
should not use certain weapons, so weapons have to be within limits, or the 
game will be unbalanced.

WEAR

Usage: wear <item> [location]

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing 
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

Examples:

  > wear boots
  > wear all.bronze
  > wear all
  > wear ring finger

WEATHER

Usage: weather

If you're uncertain whether the sun is shining or the rain is pouring down you
can use this command to check. You have to be outside for it to work.

Weather is generated randomly and can be any of the following:

   The sky starts to get cloudy
   It starts to rain
   The clouds disappear
   Lightning starts to show in the sky
   The rain stops
   The lightning stops

Feel free to make your own weather messages with trigedit, just make sure to
set the roomflag INDOORS so you don't receive the default weather messages.

WORK

   Most new builders underestimate how much work it takes to build a good zone.
Do not expect to finish everything to perfection in one week. Do not plan a 
500 room metropolis as your first zone. The typical new builder will start a 
grand project only to find themselves over their head with work after two
weeks with no end in sight. The result is almost always a sloppy, hastily 
finished product or a perpetually unfinished one. Either way the builder ends
up discouraged and their zone is unusable. To prevent this from happening all 
you have to do is PLAN. The more time you spend planning the easier time you 
will have building. There is nothing worse than making half a zone and then 
running out of ideas. You then have to start making more ideas up and they 
will not fit well into the zone.

XNAME

#31
YOU

   Many head builders prohibit the use of "you" in any descriptions. This is
done because so many new builders use it incorrectly. A builder can and should
describe everything without "you". But, in my opinion telling a writer not to 
use certain words is like telling a painter not to use certain colors.
   The key problem with using "you" is that it forces a player to think in 
your terms, not the players. Do not think for the character. Instead, write
descriptions in such a way that they will cause the reader to think what you
would like all by themselves. Innocent uses of the word "you" are easily 
written in other terms, and getting used to writing descriptions without it 
means you do not have to constantly be on guard for the incorrect usage. 
  Do not describe a player's emotions in the room, leave that up to your 
descriptive text to evoke the emotions in the player, since that will make 
things much more exciting to the player (do this by never using the word 
"you"). Some people believe that it is best to describe locations in the third 
person all the time (i.e., never reference the player). 
   Never tell a player how they feel. If you want a sad description, do not 
tell someone they are sad, write the description to make them weep. Same goes 
for scary, happy, disgusted, etc. You name it, make them feel it. Do not simply
say they are. Thinking for the character is one of the most common mistakes new 
and old builders make. Whenever you are tempted to write something that directly 
states a character's thoughts, actions, or reasoning ask yourself if it can be 
done a different way (it always can). Do not ask questions in any description. 
Remember, a player should be able to see what they look at as if they are doing 
so in real life. 

Here are some examples of "thinking for the character" descriptions: 
 
BAD:  You shudder in fear as you look upon the evil statue of Marhuk!
GOOD: The massive statue of Marhuk glowers down upon everything with an
      awful malicious expression. 
 
BAD:  You proceed cautiously through the tunnel, weapon drawn.
GOOD: The dark tunnel appears empty, but it is impossible to know what 
      might lurk just beyond the veil of darkness.
 
BAD:  The dragon is large and looks very angry at you.
GOOD: A massive dragon roars in anger, steam billowing from its nostrils.
 
BAD:  You stand in a big room, it is very dark.
GOOD: Shadows cower along the tall walls and almost seem to be moving. The 
      floor is made of heavy stones, which are very dark in color. The 
      ceiling is quite some distance above the floor, small objects hang
      from it, ruining the smoothness that is characteristic of the rest 
      of the room.

ZEDIT

Usage: zedit [room vnum]

Zedit lets you edit (online) the zone files for your particular zone.
Within zedit you can alter the loading of monsters and objects and the
closing/locking of doors etc.

If no room number is specified, the current room is used as target.

@RGOTO 11@n to enter The Builder Academy hallway on how to use zedit.

#31
ZEDIT-ADVANCED ADVANCED

   Let us say you want there to be a single rose loaded in a garden. But, you 
want to have a max of 50 in the mud. You would simply go to the command options 
menu and tell the zone file to load an object into the room. However, the object 
will continue to load into the room, until it is maxed. To prevent 50 roses 
from loading into the room, simply hit N for new command. It will ask you where
the command should be placed. Use the SAME number as the command which loads 
the rose. This will bump the command, which loads the rose down. Then you will
be at a command options menu. Enter R for remove an object from a room. If no 
one comes along and gets the rose, the game will remove it and load another 
one. This will prevent build up. 
   Zedit can not currently give a container to a mob and then load an object to
that container. A workaround for this is to load the object to the room before
loading the mob. Then attach a load trigger to the mob that will force it to
pick up the loaded container.
   Zedit is one of the tougher forms of OLC, and allows builders to cause 
errors. Use common sense. DO NOT equip doors with objects. DO NOT close a 
door then lock it (just setting it locked makes it closed). DO NOT equip 
objects. DO NOT put an object inside a mob. I can go on and on. But I would
hope you can see the sense in all this. If you have a question ask. The 
documentation is all here, help is available. Just ask someone. PLEASE!
   When loading mobs and objs through zedit the first loaded (zedit command 0)
will be the last listed in a room when it is looked at.

Mob loading through zedit is very limited in flexibility. Zone loading commands
are saved in order by room number and the resulting list is simply run through
line by line on zone reset. The problem with this is if you want to load 4 mobs
in separate rooms there is no way to check if the mobs exist and where they are.
This results in the common problem of having towns with all the gateguards at 
one gate. This can get complex, but say 4 guards are loading at the 4 
cardinal gates: north, east, south, and west with a maxload of 4 in world. The 
load commands are also saved in the zone file in that order. On the first 
zreset you would have 4 guards at the 4 gates loading in order N, E, S, W. Then
say a player kills the guards at the E, S, W, gates, next zreset a guard 
loads at the N, E, S gates (2 now at the N gate). The same player kills the 
guards at the E and S gates. Next zreset mobs load at the N and E gates, and so
on. There is no "good" solution to this. It is simply a tradeoff in the code 
due to the desire for simplicity. Most builders never need to worry about this.
But, if you do want more control on mob loading you can do it several ways. 
Make each mob unique, don't reuse the same mob for each gate, and load only 1 
of each. Or you can use trigedit to load the mob on zreset, checking if they 
already exist. Both can be very time consuming.

ZEDIT-COMMANDS ZONE-COMMANDS ZEDITCOMMANDS ZEDIT-COMMANDLISTS COMMANDLISTS COMMAND-LISTS

<Command list>
0 - END OF LIST
   Zone commands are what load mobiles and objects. This includes a 'max 
existing' argument. This specifies the maximum number of copies of the mobile 
or object that are allowed to exist in the entire world at once. If the 
number currently existing is greater than or equal to the 'max existing' 
limit, the command is not executed.
   Zone commands are listed from 0 and on. If creating a new command always
choose 0 as its number. The only exception to this is if you are making a
command that relies on the success of the other command. Choose 1 for those.
 
N) New command.
E) Edit a command.
D) Delete a command.
Q) Quit
Enter your choice : 
 
   All of these are pretty self-explanatory by this point I'd hope. The only
one we need to go over is adding and editing a command. Both are similar all
options will be explained under @RHELP ZEDIT-NEW@n.

ZEDIT-CREATE ZEDIT-CREATION ZONE-CREATE ZONE-CREATION ZCREATE CREATE-ZONE

Usage: zedit new <new zone number> <bottom of zone> <top of zone>

@OOnly Implementors can create new zones. Zones can be any size but must
consist of consecutive vnums. tbaMUD supports 0-655 zones. That means vnums 
0 -> 65500. So to create zone 350 you would type: zedit new 350 35000 35099 
for a 100 vnum zone. Which I find the easiest to manage. But, in reality you 
can create a zone of any size you want. It is my experience that most builders
rarely finish a 50 room zone so giving them over 100 is a waste of resources. 
I force most builders to start small to prove themselves before giving them 
more. When they do build a full zone of 50+ rooms, mobs, objects, etc. 
I then give them another 100. 

Examples:
   zedit new 1 100 199 - Creates zone 1 vnums 100 to 199.
   zedit new 123 12300 12499 - Creates zone 123 vnums 12300 to 12499

Max zone number is 655. Max vnum is 65534. 65535 is reserved for corpses.

ZEDIT-DELETE

To remove a single zone you will need server access and then remove
the references to the zone in the World directory index files. For
example if I want to remove zone 123 I edit the following files and
remove the line 123.<file type>:
lib/world/zon/index --Remove line of text 123.zon
lib/world/wld/index --Remove line of text 123.wld
lib/world/mob/index --Remove line of text 123.mob
lib/world/obj/index --Remove line of text 123.obj
lib/world/trg/index --Remove line of text 123.trg
lib/world/shp/index --Remove line of text 123.shp
lib/world/qst/index --Remove line of text 123.qst
One done reboot to reload the World files
You may not have index references to all of the above files.
One last note of caution if you delete a zone reference that is used
in the code for say mortal loadroom the MUD will not boot. So make
sure that zone is not used anywhere in the code.

Z) Zone name   : @yNew Zone@n
   The zone name is a label given to the zone so that it can be identified in 
system logs. As soon as you are assigned a zone give it a name.  Zone names 
will not normally be viewable by mortals.
   Do not name zones like "Rumble's Zone" it is not a descriptive title.
Use your imagination, Give your zone a proper name.  It will help us figure 
out what it is meant to be, and it will add to the game. Add your name to the    
end of the zone name to help us identify who it belongs too. If your name is
not in your zone name or zone description room it may be deleted.

ZEDIT-NEW-COMMAND ZEDIT-DOOR MOB-LOAD MOB-INVENTORY ZEDIT-NEWCOMMAND ZEDIT-LOADING ZLOADING ZEDIT-DOORS ZEDIT-REMOVE

   The number 1 mistake new builders make is not knowing what to do when they
first enter zedit. All you do is type N for new and then 0 to add the new 
command to the top of the list.  Then follow the menu which is explained below.
 
M) Load Mobile to room
  Loads a mobile to the room.
O) Load Object to room
  Loads an object to a room. 
E) Equip mobile with object
  This command should always be dependent on the mob load command before it.
  Equipping a non-existing mob will result in an error. @RHELP DEPENDENT@n.
  You do not need to load an object before equipping it to a mob. 
G) Give an object to a mobile 
  This command should always be dependent on the mob load command before it. 
  You do not need to load an object before giving it to a mob. The giving 
  assumes you want it loaded. Giving an object to a non-existing mob will 
  result in an error.
P) Put object in another object   
  Again make sure the object exists before putting another object inside it 
  There is no limit to the number of objects you can put inside.
D) Open/Close/Lock a Door
  Set the state of a door. State being one of: 0 Open, 1 Closed, 2 Closed 
  and locked. Care should be taken to set both sides of a door correctly. 
  Closing the north exit of one room does not automatically close the south
  exit of the room on the other side of the door. When setting a door locked, 
  use option 2). This will close and lock a door. It is not necessary to close
  it with one command, then lock it with another. @RHELP REDIT-EXIT@n.
R) Remove an object from the room 
  Important for reloading containers that a player may have emptied and to load
  a single instance of an object with a maxload greater than 1. @RHELP FOUNTAIN@n, 
  @RHELP ZEDIT-ADVANCED@n. You can not remove items inside a container. You must
  remove the container and then reload the container and all items
T) Assign a trigger (Advanced builders only)
  Attach a trigger to a mob, obj, or room. Usually done through REDIT, MEDIT,
  or OEDIT.  DO NOT USE THIS OPTION WITHOUT FIRST CLEARING IT WITH A GREAT GOD 
  OR ABOVE.
V) Set a global variable (Advanced builders only)
  Set a global variable to be used by triggers. @RHELP GLOBAL@n.

#31
ZEDIT-RESETS RESET-MODES

R) Reset Mode  : @yNormal reset.@n
   Can take one of three values:
   0) Never reset 
      The age of the zone is never updated, and it will never be reset. Thus,
      the value of the Lifespan is effectively ignored.
   1) Reset only when no players in zone
      Reset the zone only after it reaches its Lifespan and after the zone 
      becomes deserted, i.e. as soon as there are no players located within 
      the zone (checked once every minute). This can make a zone more "fair" 
      because it will keep the hard mobs from reappearing in the zone until 
      everyone leaves, but on a busy MUD it can prevent a zone from ever being
      reset since the zone may never stay empty for more than one minute. 
@  NOTE: Immortals are ignored if they have nohassle on.
   2) Normal reset (DEFAULT)
      Reset the zone as soon as it reaches its Lifespan, regardless of who or 
      what is in it. This is the most commonly used Reset Mode.

#31
ZEDIT-ROOM ZEDIT-NUMBER 

Room number: @c1300@n              Room zone: @c13@n
   The room number is the room you are using zedit on. It must be within your
zone. The room zone is to identify the zone. Zone numbers are the room numbers
of the zone divided by 100; for example, The Builder Academy, which consists 
of rooms 1300 through 1399, is zone 13.

#31
ZLIST

Usage: @yzlist                @n- List all zones
@y       zlist <zone>         @n- Show info for one zone
@y       zlist .              @n- Show info for the current zone
@y       zlist <zone> <zone>  @n- List a range of zones
@y       zlist <builder>      @n- List zones by one builder

This command will show a list of zones, the zone information of the zone you 
are in or the zone information of the zone number you provide.

The zone list may be limited to show a range of zones, or only show zones that
have a particular builder name in the builder list.

#31
ZLOCK

Usage: zlock <zone number>
       zlock list

Locks a zone so that building or editing is not possible.
The 'list' shows all currently locked zones.
'zlock all' will lock every zone with the GRID flag set.
'zlock all all' will lock every zone in the MUD.

ZONE-COMPLETION COMPLETED-ZONE COMPLETION

   Spell-check your zone before you submit it for the final walk-through. If
there are a million spelling errors, we will not look at the zone until those
are fixed.
   Make sure your Zone Description Room in <zone #>00 is complete. It should list
absolutely everything of importance about your zone. @RHELP ZONE-DESC@n for the
requirements. You can also use the extra description 'credits' if you wish.
   Be sure all your mobs have been auto-rolled by setting the level in medit.
This is required for balancing. Also be sure everything meets the standards
under @RHELP STANDARDS@n. 
   One last thing you could do to ensure you have built a quality zone is to
read or re-read TBA zone. It is too much info to absorb the first time through
and I guarantee it will give you new ideas and help you fix common problems. We
have to review a lot of zones with a limited staff so any help you can give us
by double-checking your own zone is greatly appreciated.
   Upon completion of a zone notify any of the staff and MUDmail Rumble. Your
zone will be looked over and corrections will be MUDmailed or emailed to you.
Do not take this personally. Everyone makes mistakes and everything we do is 
meant as constructive criticism.

#31
ZONE-DELETION DELETION

   To prevent accidentally deleting someone's zone and causing conflicting OLC
access I have made the following guide.  If someone does not login to the mud
for over a year, and does not mudmail me (Rumble) to let me know of an
expected absence their zone may be deleted.  I use show areas to list all zones
and then go through one by one using "last <playername>".  If they have not
logged in for over a year I then "stat file <playername>" and check that
they have the proper OLC set, and that they do not have the NO_DEL flag (I set
no_delete on players that tell me they are going to be absent for a while). If 
they have not been on for over a year and do not have NO_DEL set I then "show 
zone #" to double-check the zone and builder assigned.  I then use r/m/o/s/tlist
to check if they made anything of value that could be saved and donated.
   Once I am positive it is safe to delete their zone I set their OLC to off.
"set file <playername> olc off" then "stat file <playername>" to be sure it 
worked and then delete the zone from the server withe the RemoveWorld script.

#31
ZONE-DESCRIPTION-ROOM ZONE_DESCRIPTION_ROOM 00 EXAMPLE-ZONE-DESCRIPTIONS ZONE-INFO TEST-ZONE TRIAL-ZONE ZONE-DESCRIPTIONS ZEDIT-DESCRIPTION

Your zone proposal should be cut and pasted into your "Zone Description Room",
which will be in room <zone #>00 (first room in your zone). In this credit room you 
should update your zone proposal as required to keep a summary of any important
information about your zone. This room will have no exits and should only be 
accessible by immortals. It is there for you and the immortals that come after 
you to get a basic idea of the zone without having to explore the whole thing. 
If you have any planned links or possible exits or entrances to another zone, 
make sure that you list them there. For examples goto the following rooms: 
8600, 10600, 20000. Add anything to this room that you think would make it 
easier to administer the zone on a MUD.

ZONE-SIZES SIZES

   Make sure to have some idea of how many rooms total you will use. Make a 
definite decision. 20, 40, 80, 100. Try and shoot for a multiple of 20. We 
have no minimum amount that we set for a zone in terms of how many rooms. But, 
we do limit new builders to only 100 vnums for their first zone. Make a
quality zone and we do not care how many rooms it is. 
   If this is your first area, keep it small. Even under 50 rooms! You will 
soon see this is a fair amount of work and gives you quite a bit of room to 
accomplish what you have in mind. Once you have completed something of this 
size and are proud of your work, you can always add to it or make another
larger zone later. If this is not your first zone, decide how many rooms you 
will need and divide it up into 100 room zones. A cluster of small areas that 
get phased in gradually is much better than one gigantic area that is never
completed. Trust us when we tell you a 300-room area will never be finished 
without Herculean effort of which most of us are not capable.
