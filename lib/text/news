NEW COMMANDS AND NEW MUD BEHAVIOR:
---------------------------------
**  Over 100 new socials, check them out and feel free to suggest new ones.

**  You will now be notified when you have new mail.

**  New toggles: autoloot, autogold, autosplit, autosac, and autoassist.

**  Improved toggle command allowing more options.

**  You can now use the history command to see the last 100 communications
    from all the channels. It clears upon viewing or log off.

**  Your mail will now be saved so you will not lose it when you log off.

**  You can now use the AFK toggle to let people see you are gone under
    who.

**  You now have almost 180 stock zones to play.

**  You can now interact with rooms, mobs, and objects through triggers.

**  Multiple objects will now be stacked and preceeded by a quantity so
    your inventory won't be as long. (3) A waybread.

**  Over 100 new socials, and the gemote command to use socials over the 
    gossip channel. Socials can now target bodyparts too, behave.

**  You can now use color! @RHELP COLORCODES@n.

**  Added new invisible mobs and objects so everything may not be as it
    appears (not even visible with detect invis).

**  Added an online dictionary. Tell m-w <word>.

**  The player description length has been increased so please write a 
    decent description for yourself.

**  You can now set your pagelength with the same command.

**  You can now "look around" to see anything of interest in the room. But,
    some things may still be hidden and require further investigation.

**  You can now use "all" and "all.x" very generally with the get, put,
    drop, junk, donate, give, wear and remove commands.  Type HELP GET
    for more info.

**  The "track" function will show you the first step on the shortest
    path to anyone in the game.

**  You can now remove your own messages from the board.  Also, if you
    put someone else's name in parentheses in the message header, they
    will be able to remove the message too.

**  The MIDGAARD MAIL SYSTEM is now complete.  The Post Office is north
    of the entrance to the Grunting Boar inn.  Stamps cost 150 coins.

**  Fountains have now been implemented.  You can drink from fountains
    or fill containers from fountains using the FILL command.

**  The SHOUT command, as always, only reaches people in your zone (you
    can see who these people are by typing WHERE).  The HOLLER command
    reaches everyone in the game but costs extra movement points.

**  When you are writing a message, you will now not be interrupted
    by tells, shouts, emotes, socials, and even people talking in the
    same room.

*****************************************************************************
    IF YOU LEAVE THE GAME FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, either by renting or plain
    quitting, your hit points, move points, and mana will be fully restored
    when you come back!  This doesn't work if you're poisoned.

**  Use the ASSIST command to engage in mortal combat with someone in the
    room who is getting pummeled.

**  Use the SPLIT command to split gold among the members of your group
    (including yourself) who are in the room.  i.e. If you are in a group
    with 4 other people who are in the room with you, type "SPLIT 100"
    to give each of them 20 coins.

**  You can use the VISIBLE command to break a spell of invisibility before
    it expires.
