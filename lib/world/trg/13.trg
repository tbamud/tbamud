Room Door Example~
2 c 100
move~
*%door% <vnum> < direction> < field> [value]
*Used for adding, deleting, and modifying doors in room #vnum.
*Direction determines which door is being changed, and can be north, south, east, west, up, or down.
*If the door does not exist first, a new door will be created.
*Field is what property of the door is being changed. Valid fields are:
*
*purge - remove the exit in the direction specified - no value needed
*description -  value will become the new exit description
*flags - value will be the new door flags bitvector as defined here:
*  a - Exit is a door that can be opened and closed.
*  b - The door is closed.
*  c - The door is locked.
*  d - The door is pick-proof.
*key - value is the vnum of the key to the door in this direction
*name - value is the name of the door in the specified direction
*room - value is the vnum of the room this direction leads to

*Example by Falstar for room 14520
*The following trigger is designed to reveal a trapdoor leading down when Player types 'Move Chest'
*
*The following ARGument determines what can be MOVEd ('move' Command inserted in Arg List of trigger)
if ("%arg%" == "chest")
*
*Send text to player to show effect of command
%send% %actor% You move the chest across the floor, revealing a trapdoor underneath!!
*
*Send text to other players in room to inform them of Player's discovery
%echoaround% %actor% %actor.name% has discovered a hidden trapdoor under a chest!
*
* Set door flags to 'ab' - Exit is a door that can be opened and closed, then close door
%door% 14520 down flags ab
* Change door name to 'trapdoor' (used in door commands, eg open trapdoor, lock trapdoor)
%door% 14520 down name trapdoor
* Set room that trapdoor exits leads to (Room 14521 in this case)
%door% 14520 down room 14521
*Set Exit desc for the wary adventure who decides to 'look down'
%door% 14520 down description A wooden ladder leads down into the darkness.
*Set the Vnum of the KEY OBJECT which will lock/unlock door
%door% 14520 down key 14500
*
* Now for Continuity, door commands must be set for reverse direction FROM 14521
%door% 14521 up flags ab
%door% 14521 up name trapdoor
%door% 14521 up room 14520
%door% 14521 up description A wooden ladder leads up into a storeroom.
%door% 14521 up key 14500
*
* IMPORTANT: Note reverse of direction in both the commands and extra descriptions and room numbers
*            it can be very easy to get lost here and probably get your adventurer lost too.
*
*Finally set up what happens when adventurer tries to move anything else and end the trigger
*
else
%send% %actor% Move what ?!
