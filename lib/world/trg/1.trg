set txt[1] the judge will do some things to you which are thought to be terrifying, but how can he stop you from taking the punishment he threatened?
set txt[2] what are the benefits of a stoic life? It is an ancient and honorable package of advice on how to stay out of the clutches of those who are trying to get you on the hook, trying to give you a feeling of obligation, trying to get moral leverage.
set txt[3] There can be no such thing as being the "victim" of another. You can only be a "victim" of yourself.
set txt[4] Show me a man who though sick is happy, who though in danger is happy, who though in prison is happy, and I'll show you a Stoic.
set txt[5] remember you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses - if short, then in a short one. If long, then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, see that you act it well.
set txt[6] Things that are not within our own power, not without our Will, can by no means be either good or evil.
set txt[7] For it is better to die of hunger, exempt from fear and guilt, than to live in affluence with perturbation.
set txt[8] Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the Will. Say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find such things to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself.
set txt[9] Look not for any greater harm than this: destroying the trustworthy, self-respecting well-behaved man within you.
set txt[10] Fear was not something that came out of the shadows of the night and enveloped you. He charged you with the total responsibility of starting it, stopping it, controlling it.
set txt[11] For it is within you, that both your destruction and deliverance lie.
set txt[12] Tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. You can have these only if you are honest and take responsibility for your own actions. You've got to get it straight! You are in charge of you.
set txt[13] nobody can harm you without your permission. There can be no such thing as a victim, you can only be a victim of yourself.
set txt[14] Where, then, does the great evil and the great good lie in man? In the attitude of his will, and if that element stands firm and neither his self respect, nor his faithfulness, nor his intelligence be destroyed, then the man is also preserved.
set txt[15] When a man who has set his will neither on dying nor upon living at any cost, comes into the presence of the tyrant, what is there to prevent him from being without fear? Nothing.
set txt[16] it is better that man not deserve anything he does not control. Otherwise, he will go after what is not his, and this is the start of crime, wars, you name it.
set txt[17] every man bears the exclusive responsibility for his own good and evil. This makes it impossible for one person to do the wrong and make another, the innocent, suffer.
set txt[18] No one comes to his fall because of another's deed. No one is evil without loss or damage. No man can do wrong with impunity.
set txt[19] There can be no such thing as a victim, you can only be a victim of yourself.
set txt[20] A man's master is he who is able to confer or remove what that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others, else he must necessarily be a slave.

set txt[24] Men are disturbed not by things, but by the view that they take of them. Do not be concerned with things which are beyond your power. Demand not that events should happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen and you will get on well.
set txt[25] Lameness is an impediment to the body but not to the will.
set txt[26] We have devised a series of operating signals. The third means "repeat," just make three taps, waves, or whatever you can do.

set txt[1] it is not only in the loss of men, horses, and guns but in order, courage, confidence, cohesion and plan which come into consideration whether the engagement can still be continued or not. It is principally the moral forces which decide here.
set txt[2] failures of management and engineering are tactical shortcomings that can be fixed but that failures of leadership's nerve and character are terminal, catastrophic.
set txt[3] War is a special profession, however general its relation may be and even if all the male population of a country capable of bearing arms were able to practice it, war would still continue to be different and separate from any other activity.
set txt[4] The purpose of power is to permit moral ideas to take root.
set txt[5] Rights incur obligations.
set txt[6] In war, the moral is to the physical as three is to one.
set txt[7] Education is what's left over after you've forgotten all the facts you learned.
set txt[8] We have devised a series of operating signals. The first one says "no," "danger," "stop," or any connotation of the negative. For this use any one signal - a single thump, a single noise, a single flash, a single wave.
set txt[9] There are advantages to a commander when his troops know he cannot be contacted. They cannot ask for relief.
set txt[10] Those who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.
set txt[11] Sentiment rules the world, and he who fails to take that into account can never hope to lead.
set txt[12] The nation that will insist on drawing a broad line of demarcation between the fighting man and the thinking man is liable to find its fighting done by fools and its thinking done by cowards.
set txt[13] Don't just sit there and pray; get out and do something to better the World.
set txt[14] The educated man, particularly the educated leader, copes with the fact that life is not fair. The problem for education is not to teach people how to deal with success but how to deal with failure.
set txt[15] The name of the game in war is to break the enemy's will.

set txt[2] Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings, so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for.
set txt[3] No evil can befall a good man
set txt[4] You alone are in possession of the fundamental freedom of shaping your own attitude about what is going on.
set txt[5] He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.
set txt[6] And in knowing that you know nothing, that makes you the smartest of all.
set txt[7] To find yourself, think for yourself
set txt[8] My belief is that to have no wants is divine
set txt[9] I know nothing except the fact of my ignorance
set txt[10] By all means get married, If you get a good wife you'll become happy; If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher
set txt[11] As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.
set txt[12] We have devised a series of operating signals. The second one says "yes," "go," "concur," "execute," "good." For this we use any two of anything - the most efficient signal except for the single beat "no" signal.

set txt[4] They do certainly give very strange, and newfangled, names to diseases.
set txt[5] The measure of a man is what he does with power.
set txt[6] The greatest wealth is to live content with little.
set txt[7] The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depend upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily.
set txt[8] For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.
set txt[9] And now I depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death, and they, too, go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong; and I must abide by my award - let them abide by theirs.
set txt[10] Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.
set txt[11] Necessity, who is the mother of invention.
set txt[12] You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.
set txt[13] When men speak ill of you, live so as nobody may believe them.
set txt[14] Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws.
set txt[15] One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors.

set txt[18] Never discourage anyone...who continually makes progress, no matter how slow.

set txt[2] a good man with a flaw who had come to an unjustified bad end.
set txt[3] All paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind.
set txt[4] Education is the best provision for the journey to old age.
set txt[5] To perceive is to suffer.
set txt[6] The gods too are fond of a joke.
set txt[7] We are what we repeatedly do.
set txt[8] Misfortune shows those who are not really friends.
set txt[9] Hope is a waking dream.
set txt[10] Dignity consists not in possessing honors, but in the consciousness that we deserve them.
set txt[11] It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.
set txt[12] Man perfected by society is the best of all animals; he is the most terrible of all when he lives without law, and without justice.
set txt[13] I have gained this by philosophy: that I do without being commanded what others do only from fear of the law.
set txt[14] It is possible to fail in many ways...while to succeed is possible only in one way.
set txt[15] In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief; to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds.
set txt[16] Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.
set txt[17] He who is to be a good ruler must have first been ruled.
set txt[18] There was never a genius without a tincture of madness.

set txt[22] The unfortunate need people who will be kind to them; the prosperous need people to be kind to.
set txt[23] Youth is easily deceived, because it is quick to hope.
set txt[24] Teaching is the highest form of understanding.
set txt[25] Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit

set txt[1] Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.
set txt[2] Everything has its beauty but not everyone sees it.
set txt[3] Forget injuries, never forget kindnesses.
set txt[4] It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop.
set txt[5] Respect yourself and others will respect you.
set txt[6] Study the past if you would define the future.
set txt[7] The superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come. When in a state of security he does not forget the possibility of ruin. When all is orderly, he does not forget that disorder may come.
set txt[8] What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.
set txt[9] Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart.
set txt[10] By nature, men are nearly alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.
set txt[11] A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake.
set txt[12] If you know, to recognize that you know, If you don't know, to realize that you don't know: That is knowledge.
set txt[13] Never hesitate to ask a lesser person.
set txt[14] People with virtue must speak out; People who speak are not all virtuous.
set txt[15] What you do not wish upon yourself, extend not to others.
set txt[16] We take great pains to persuade other that we are happy than in endeavoring to think so ourselves.
set txt[17] Better a diamond with a flaw than a pebble without.
set txt[18] The people may be made to follow a path of action, but they may not be made to understand it.
set txt[19] The superior man is modest in his speech, but exceeds in his actions.
set txt[20] The superior man...does not set his mind either for anything, or against anything; what is right he will follow.
set txt[21] To go beyond is as wrong as to fall short.
set txt[22] Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.
set txt[23] What the superior man seeks is in himself. What the mean man seeks is in others.
set txt[24] What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
set txt[25] When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it - this is knowledge.
set txt[26] In any prisoner situation when you are communicating with a fellow prisoner be sure to agree about a danger signal first. Second make a cover story in case you are caught, and third, you need to decide on a backup communication system.

set txt[1] Francis Bacon once said, "Adversity doth best to induce virtue...while luxury doth best induce vice."
set txt[2] To quote Glenn Gray, "Numberless soldiers have died, more or less willingly, not for country or honor or religious faith or for any other abstract good, but because they realized that by fleeing their posts and rescuing themselves, they would expose their companions to greater danger. Such loyalty to the group is the essence of fighting morale."
set txt[3] Glenn Gray said, "Nothing is clearer than that men can act contrary to the alleged basic instinct of self-preservation and against all motives of self-interest and egoism. Were it not so, the history of our civilization would be completely different than what it has been."
set txt[4] At its best, citizenship finds an equilibrium between two essential ingredients-that of rights and that of duties. When the idea of citizenship is losing its grip, one or the other of these elements becomes eroded. Either freedom is on the losing end, or the sense of duty, of obligation, goes down the drain.
set txt[5] Ariel and Will Durant said it best, "Freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies, and when one prevails the other dies."
set txt[6] As a people we have become soft. Stress isn't a bad thing. It is actually good for you, particularly the kind that comes from physical exercise.
set txt[7] Ariel and Will Durant said, "What determines whether the challenge of history will or will not be met depends upon the presence or absence of creative individuals with a clarity of mind and energy of will, capable of effective responses to new situations.
set txt[8] Once one learns to accomodate the shocks of a stressful existence, his adrenalin, will power, and imagination are going to start churning to provide the maximum performance of the human mind.
set txt[9] Would a good soldier fighting a tough battle stop to say to himself how unhappy he is?
set txt[10] Remember Herman Melville? "In time of peril, like the needle to the lodestone, obedience, irrespective of rank, generally flies to him who is best fitted to command."
set txt[11] There is no evidence that the way of the World assures the punishment of evil or the reward of virtue.
set txt[12] Humans seem to have an inborn need to believe that virtue will be rewarded and evil punished. Often, when they come face to face with the fact that this is not always so, they are crushed.
set txt[13] From the Book of Ecclesiastes, "I returned and saw that the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise nor riches to men of understanding, nor favors to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all."
set txt[14] The key to our future leaders' merit may not be "hanging in there" when the light at the end of the tunnel is expected. It will be their performance when it looks like the light will never show up.
set txt[15] Mark Van Doren was right, "Being an educated person means that given the necessity [after doomsday, so to speak], you could refound your own civilization."
set txt[16] Captain McWhirr said "to go skimming over the years of existence to sink gently into a placid grave, ignorant of life to the last, without ever having been made to see all it may contain of perfidy, of violence, of terror."
set txt[17] Harry Truman said, "Men make history, and not the other way around."
set txt[18] Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote, "When one tries to rise above nature, one is liable to fall below it. The highest type of man may revert to the animal if he leaves the straight road of destiny. Consider, that the materialists, the sensualists, the worldy would all prolong their worthless lives. The spiritual would now avoid the call to something higher. It would be the survival of the least fit. What sort of cesspool may not our poor world become?"
set txt[19] Remember when you are strung up by the ropes that they can get out of you only what they know you know.
set txt[20] A hero is a man who will not accept the status quo if it does not meet his standards.
set txt[21] Any officer worth his salt, on detached duty and out of communication, has to have the right to sensibly modify the law, issue rules that fit the conditions, and be prepared to defend himself in court.
set txt[22] My experience is a perfect example of the hermetic - the alchemical transformation that may occur when a human being is subjected to intense pressure within a crucible of suffering or confinement.
set txt[23] Dostoyevsky was a wise man, "You see, gentlemen, reason is an excellent thing, there's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life, including reason and all the impulses."
set txt[24] I once read from Nichmachean Ethics: "There are some instances in which such actions elicit forgiveness rather than praise, for example, when a man acts improperly under a strain greater than human nature can bear, and which no one could endure. Yet there are, perhaps, also acts which no man can possibly be compelled to do, but rather than do them he should accept the most terrible sufferings and death."
set txt[25] Wittgenstein is known for, "If it comes easy, it ain't worth a damn."
set txt[26] Fr. Marius recalls someone remarking, "The important thing is not what they've made of you, but what you made of what they've made of you."
set txt[27] It was only when I lay there on the rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not between states nor between classes nor between political parties, but right through every human heart, through all human hearts. And that is why I turn back to the years of my imprisonment and say, "Bless you, prison, for having been a part of my life."
set txt[28] my rules are: BACK US: Don't Bow in public, stay off the Air, admit no Crimes, never Kiss them goodbye, Unity over Self. Never negotiate for yourself but only for us all. Not less than significant pain should cause you to submit.
set txt[29] The lecture-room of the philosopher is a hospital, students ought not to walk out of it in pleasure, but in pain.
set txt[30] I knew I could contain material - so long as they didn't know I knew it.
set txt[31] Opportunities don't roll in as a saturating fog bank. They come as incidents. And you need spontaneity and instinct to capture them.
set txt[32] Society's main objective is to instill virtue in its citizenry and that specific laws are a secondary concern.
set txt[33] In prison I have concluded that the pincers of fear and guilt are the destroyers of men. Nothing else.
set txt[34] The challenge of education is not to prepare people for success but to prepare them for failure. I think that it's in hardship and failure that the heroes and the bums really get sorted out.
set txt[35] Solzhenitsyn once commented, "If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being, and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"
set txt[36] Edward Hidalgo once said, "Avoiding failure is not success." How right he was.
set txt[37] Clemenceau believed that, "War is too important to be left to the generals."
set txt[38] I once asked Will Durant what he thought of American foreign policy. He told me, "I think we're all mixed up. We seem to be working on the assumption that if we're nice to other people they'll be nice to us. I can tell you that in the last 4000 years there's practically no evidence to support that view."
set txt[39] Alfred Thayer Mahan believed that, "the purpose of power is to permit moral ideas to take root."
set txt[39] The Durants said that "culture is a thin and fragile veneer that superimposes itself on mankind."
set txt[40] The ones where are in trouble in here are the high school graduates who had enough sense to pick up the innuendo, and yet not enough education to accommodate it properly. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
set txt[41] Prof Hans Morgethau once postulated, "In the world of the intellectual, ideas meet with ideas, and anything goes that is presented cleverly and with assurance. But in the practical world, ideas meet with facts, facts which make mincemeat of wrong ideas and throw the pieces in the ashcan of history."
set txt[42] The greatest weapon our interrogators have against us is our own shame. They know how to manipulate it, our only protection is a clear conscience.
set txt[42] We seem to have burdened ourselves with a national self-consciousness that has become a self-inflicted wound of guilt, a national shame at being strong.
set txt[43] No one had to remind our founding fathers of the cost of freedom. 56 of them knowingly laid their lives, liberty and honor on the line when they signed that Declaration of Independence. And they paid their dues. In the ensuing war, nine were killed in action, five died as prisoners of war, twelve had their homes burned, several lost sons, one man's wife died in prison, and seventeen (including Thomas Jefferson) went broke.
