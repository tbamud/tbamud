set opening1 Upon opening the pack a strong vanilla note hits me,
set opening2 A slight hint of vanilla hits me as I open the pack,
set opening3 There was a slight hint of vanilla when I opened the pack,
set opening4 Opening the pack I was treated to a lovely vanilla scented
tobacco,
set opening5 This particular pouch smells rather sweet, possibly vanilla,
set opening6 First let me say that this pouch was really sweet smelling,
set opening7 This sweet smelling pouch made me wonder about the quality of the
tobacco,
set opening8 I had a bit of trouble with the tin,
set look1 but inside was an excellent well rubbed tobacco.
set look2 and inside I was treated to a nice well rubbed tobacco.
set look3 but I found a nice rubbed tobacco inside.
set look4 but it produced a nice pinch of reddish tobacco.
set look5 yet it was filled with beautiful flakes of tobacco.
set look6 but the tobacco was too lightly packed. It was uneven and packed
funny into the pipe.
set look7 and I couldn't help noticing how great this would be for the room
note.
set look8 and yet I found an excellent nugget of tobacco waiting inside.
set moisture1 It was a bit wet at first,
set moisture2 It was pretty damp out of the pack,
set moisture3 The pack had far too much dampness to it,
set moisture4 It was deliciously moist,
set moisture5 It was a little wet for my tastes,
set moisture6 There was no way this would light in my pipe,
set drying1 but I let it sit on a napkin for %random.3% hours.
set drying2 but I air-dried it and it turned out fine.
set drying3 so I put it in a napkin for a bit to make it smokeable.
set drying4 so I wrapped it in a napkin and forgot about it for a few hours.
set drying5 so being me, I tried lighting it as it was. Big mistake. My next
batch I let sit out before lighting up.
set drying6 but this was easily fixed by letting it dry out on my desk.
set drying7 but I like my tobacco a bit on the wet side, so I only aired it
for 20 minutes.
set drying8 and it took a while to dry, but it lit beautifully afterwards.
set mix1 A well honed mix of Virginia and Burley, this mix stood the test of
time.
set mix2 This mix suited my briar quite well as I'd smoked plenty of
Virginia/Burley in the past in it.
set mix3 It was worth it, this is an excellent mix of Virginia and Burley.
set mix4 I quite enjoyed the Virginia notes inside of the Burley base of this
tobacco.
set mix5 Your standard Virginia and Burley mixed, this particular mix stands
set mix6 A pleasant Virginia/Burley, although nothing out of the ordinary.
set mix7 I could taste a strong note of Burley on this particular specimen,
but not sure what else.
set mix8 As always, this excellent blend worked well for my morning pipe.
set burn1 The burn on this batch was rather mild flavored, but not any more
than you'd normally suspect.
set burn2 Rather mild, but quite aromatic. I quite liked this pouch.
set burn3 Nice and mild, but with a slight kick to it. I was enjoying it so
much I went a bit too fast.
set burn4 Rather bland flavor to be honest, but I like my tobacco strong and
my coffee black.
set burn5 A bit on the softer side as far as burn goes, but a rich, smooth
flavor.
set burn6 Great mild taste, but pretty well beginner only.
set burn7 The tobacco itself had a mild taste, but would make an excellent
pipe for after dessert.
set burn8 I didn't pack my pipe properly, so I didn't get to enjoy this as
much as I'd have liked to.
set price1 Definitely worth the price.
set price2 Pretty cheap tobacco, but for good reason.
set price3 I think given the flavor and quality of the tobacco the price
matches up.
set price4 The price is pretty reasonable for what you're getting. It's an
excellent beginners pouch.
set price5 A nice starter-oriented price. This tobacco won't break the bank
and is mild enough to start with, but any true conniseur will move on soon.
set price6 With today's gas prices, I don't know why I spend so much on
tobacco. Must be the addiction.
set price7 Excellently priced, as usual.
set price8 This bowl really took me back to my college days when I first tried
this mix.
