rat tail~
   The apparant tail of what seems to be an unusually large rat.  Though it
seems to give you quivers of sickness, it must be a fierce weapon.

secret safe~
   It is a titanium safe that is implanted into the wall.  It has a industrial
strength lock that only not even the craftiest thief could pick.  Otherwise, it
could easily go unnoticed.

Backstabber~
   This is the legendary Backstabber.  It is the ultimate symbol of all that
thieves believe in.  The bronze blade is of Roman design and is reinforced with
iron and what appears to be gold.  Legend has it that it was the same dagger
that commited the first backstabbing, done on Julius Ceasar.  It has black
runes on it, the ancient code of the thieves.  Just holding makes you feel like
you feel not just like a million dollars, but that you could steal a million
dollars.

smelly red key~
   It is an iron key.  It seems to have flakes of red paint that give the key a
red look.  It is slightly heavy, but you hardly care.  What seems to matter is
that it is extremely smelly, probably from years in the sewers.
