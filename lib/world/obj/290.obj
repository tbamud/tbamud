key useless~
   This key is completely useless since it cannot be picked up and to get to it,
the door it unlocks must be unlocked...  Hmmmmm, I'm sure that there is some
obscure reason for it though...  
~
E
reason~
   There is absolutely no reason for this key except to be an ignorant item that
no one can get.  The bonuses are in case some Id's it and should be ignored
since the item cannot be used anyways.
