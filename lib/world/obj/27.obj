I do not yet know, but I know that the sorceress has a particular way of
keeping her secrets, and it does not involve the survival of witnesses.

                       THIRD AGE - AGE OF REBIRTH

This is an accounting of things future, the third age.

With the canvas wiped clean and the hearts of the Cui weighed heavy with
grief and regret, they will invest their last energies in creating a new race. A
form of life that embodies the whole scope of the balance, having the ability to
sway itself to dark or light as it pleases.

The internal nature of these opposing forces means that the race will have to
keep peace within itself or suffer complete self-inflicted destruction. Thus,
along with the power to choose, this life will have the burning desire of its
Cui makers to continue itself, to survive, to flourish and grow.

With only one of the Cui remaining, this race is left almost entirely to its own
devices, only a few perceiving and heeding the whisperings of their sole
remaining parent and the occasional Ve offspring.

Beyond this point no speaking creature can see.

                        SECOND AGE - AGE OF RECONCILIATION

This is an accounting of things present, the second age.

The Second Age began with the creating of a new race, a neutral race,
intended to bridge the gap between those of darkness and those of light.
Peace-loving and friendly, it was hoped that this race (the race of Memlins)
would act as mediator, allowing interactions between all three races without
the clash and destruction of war.

Unfortunately, although this intervention did stem the flow of blood, a new
war began for domination over memlin-kind, with the Khan'li seeking to
enslave them and the Dynar seeking to convert them. Caught in the middle,
the dismayed call of memlin-kind for peace goes largely unheeded, and slowed
but not stopped the destruction continues its insidious spread.

Here begins the accounting of things future, the prophecies of the Ve.

The carnage will continue, memlin-kind being destroyed, Khan'li and Dynar
once again preparing to take up the battlefield. At this point, the now almost
extinct Cui will make one last desperate effort to create harmonius miru life.
Coming together, they will cause a massive wave of destruction, completely
wiping out all of their own creation. With the blood-soaked ground cleansed
and uninhabited the third age will begin.

                        FIRST AGE - AGE OF SORROW

 This is an accounting of things past, the first age.

The first efforts of the Cui in shaping their world resulted in the separating
of Denuo  into two major root forms - Khan'li, those of darkness, and Dynar,
those of light, the intention being that the interactions between the two would
allow for motion of forces whilst keeping the balance relatively stable.

However, the Cui were not prepared for the outright carnage that resulted.
Dynar and Khan'li both working to slaughter the other and spilling oceans of
blood, destroying many of their sub-races that Cui had sacrificed themselves to
create.

Dismayed, the Cui sought to make peace between the two, realising that all
they had worked for was about to destroy itself. Finally, they sought to make
a more drastic change...

A folded note lies dropped here.~

Ah, I have a small task for you faithful one.

No doubt you know of the Dynar scum that came here to kill me. Well, as
expected he was of no match against my protector. Unfortunately, the
wretched creature had a powerful weapon with him, infused with Dynar
magic. It has utterly overcome my protector, poisoned him beyond the point
of return, and although he remains loyal to me I cannot have an item of such
power in the hands of one so corrupted.

He no doubt knows this himself, for he has hidden himself away with the help
of those worthless memlins. They call him the toothy one, and I have finally
found the door to his hideout, although he has actually invoked some Dynar
magic to keep me out.

In any case, if I cannot break in, I shall make certain he never gets out. This
is where your task comes in.

Go into the heart of the mines, there in a niche to the east you will find a
group of memlins digging at the southern wall. This is where the hidden
ivorydoor lies, and no doubt they will have had no success at breaking
through.

It is of no matter as I have acquired the key, which you should have received
along with this note. Your job now is simply to dispose of the memlins
involved however you see fit, and discover if in fact that wretched creature
is even still alive in that self-made tomb.

That is all.
