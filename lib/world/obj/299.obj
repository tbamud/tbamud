   The corpse lying here is disgusting at best.  Looking closely at it, you
notice that it has been disembowled, but can find no trace of the entrails
whatsoever.

E
altar~
   The altar before you is covered with glyphs and symbols that mean nothing to
you.  It obviously is not the original altar that was in this cathedral.  There
are fresh blood stains down the side of it and the top is stained a very deep
brown.

   This has got to be the largest weapon you have ever seen.  Sure, halberds are
normally big, but this has got to be at least twice as big as any other halberd
you've seen.  How any mortal can even hope to use it, you are not sure, but it
is definitely something you wouldn't want to get hit by....
