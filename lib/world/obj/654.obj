   This subdivision was built to use with the TBA housing code since the code
needs rooms that have already been created.  It's a very simple plan with 38
houses, meant to simplify the placing of houses.  Feel free to make any changes.
Look map for a better idea of the layout.

   To assign the houses, stand in any main room with the player and use hcontrol.

   *WARNING* Before setting the first house, please check for the file lib/house.
This will sometimes be deleted as an empty file.  The house contents will not
save without this directory!

   If you want to use this subdivision but need more than 38 houses, First and
Second Streets can be continued to the east by changing the room names and some
of the exit descriptions.  First and Second Avenue would need to be changed to
Third and Fourth Avenue.

   If you need more space, you might want to change #3 and #8 Second Street to
continue the Avenues southward and change #3 and #8 First Street of the new
section to match.  Of course, First and Second Street would become Third and
Fourth Streets.

Sorry for any errors.  Please wash this wall with zedit.

   This keychain, when held in a room away from the subdivision, will bring
you to the subdivision intersection of First Street and First Avenue to make
it easier to find your way home.  If you hold it again, anywhere in the
subdivision, it will take you back to where you came from.
