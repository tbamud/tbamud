codex stone massive~
   This massive codex was placed here by the Halfling God, Jojen.  A thin,
spiralling script covers its surface, telling the tale of the Graveyard above.
The Graveyard is a place where newbie characters are able to become used to the
commands of the mud as well as gather a few pieces of equipment that will help
them survive the harsh reality of the world.  The mobiles in the Graveyard are
of both evil and good virtues, so the player may decide which to kill in the
case of alignment- driven roleplaying.  The zone itself is to look realistic
within the fantasy realms and will not include any t-shirts, beastly fidos, nor
a Ring of Newbie Helping.  With luck and work, the Graveyard will be enjoyable
to play and beneficial to the new player as well without the use of cadets,
training dummies, or janitors.
