death, whosoever would give their life to love, make war with my darkness."
Wield this fabled blade of lost love, and become one with the shadows.

god Balm himself.  Etched in runes across the head of the spear are these words.

a wicked spike giving this ancient weapon the look of a warped headsman's axe.
No light seems to reach it, no living thing seeks its touch.  Tendrils of sickly
smoke rise from the blade tainting your thoughts and the very air around you.  
It calls you, it draws you.  "Wield me, worship me, watch me take the blood of
the pure.  Become one with my taint.  Feel the foulness fermenting your soul.  
Accept evil, accept the shadow.  Wield me and become death.  Become immortal."

purpose.  Etched into the two heads of the axe are these words.  "Slash, slice,
swerve and swipe.  Dodge, duck, down and up.  I draw the blood of the weak.

guards eternal flame quest~
   Guardians of history, heroes of legend, Ancients of elder years.  These are
the Guards worn by those chosen to rule all of Drake kind.  The material that
forms them glows and smokes like living flame.  However, it is cool to the
touch, forming an impenetrable barrier against all attacks.  These leggings seem
to shimmer before your very eyes, fact or fiction, they look as though they
could vanish at any turn.  Looking deep into the fire that is their strength you
see these words in yellow and red flame.  "Drawn from the depths.  Delivered
from death.  Directed by Divinity.  I am the truth.  The light.  The guardian of
hope and the future.  Find comfort in my flames.  Find strength in my touch.  
For with me lies all that is to come."
