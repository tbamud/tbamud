death, whosoever would give their life to love, make war with my darkness."
Wield this fabled blade of lost love, and become one with the shadows.

No light seems to reach it, no living thing seeks its touch.  Tendrils of sickly
smoke rise from the blade tainting your thoughts and the very air around you.
It calls you, it draws you.  "Wield me, worship me, watch me take the blood of
the pure.  Become one with my taint.  Feel the foulness fermenting your soul.
Accept evil, accept the shadow.  Wield me and become death.  Become immortal."
