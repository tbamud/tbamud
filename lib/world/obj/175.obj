   Greetings, adventurer!
   I have hoped for many years that one such as you would come! I have great 
need of your aid to help me in my plight. I am the Eastern Wizard, one of the 
two Wizardly champions of Neutrality.
   My counterpart, Tokar of the West, has been kidnapped by Carcophan, the evil 
Wizard of the South and Trilless, the Northen Sorceress of Good. The two locked 
him away behind two doors, and each has a key.
   Tokar's enslavement has weakened me severely, and whilst he is trapped I am 
far too weak to challenge both Carcophan and Trilless on my own.
   Without you to stop them, Carcophan and Trilless will battle throughout 
eternity and eventually all the balance that Tokar and I have spent our lives 
trying to achieve will come to nothing. I beg you for your aid in this.
   If you accept this duty from me, go to the northern wall. There is a hidden 
door in the stone of the cliff, which can be unlocked magically with this 
scroll in your possession.
   Beyond the door, you will find an entrance to the Wizard's Mansion, and from 
there you can find both Trilless and Carcophan. But beware, both are well 
guarded, and you would do well to buy equipment from me for your quest.
   I wish you luck, my friend. You'll need it.
- Shadimar

allowing the blackness beyond to show through.  It sucks the light and warmth
from the room, and gives off a nearly suffocating odour of vile evil.

inscription~
   Good friend,
   At great expense to myself I have sent you this warning. Trilless the 
Northern Sorceress defends herself with strong creatures of the deep and 
raging waters. Once you enter her river, it will sweep you forth with no 
respite.
   I strongly advise against taking the Northern Sorceress's river without 
proper preparations. She is well defended, and if underprepared you will 
surely perish.
