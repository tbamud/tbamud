   You open the book and begin to read:

	Many ages ago, the great paladin knight Graye defeated
the Demon lord, and his disciples Irgon and Scrytin, and banished
them to to bowels of the earth from which they came.  Years passed
and Graye's descendants prospered.  The city of Graye has been ruled
for many hundreds of years by wise kings, directly descended from 
Graye himself.

The book goes on to list dozens of names of kings..

        I fear my magic is not enough..every day the demons
get stronger...my people are living in fear..we cannot go 
on like this.  Noone save myself knows of the secret passage
beneath the throne room, perhaps I should take it and confront
the enemy?   But I cannot leave my people here alone..and the
legasy of Graye must never fall into enemy hands.  What is that!
The sounds of fighting?! In the Castle?!  I must...
 
The next few sentences are unintelligible..they say something
about a spell being cast on this room to bar the demon's entry
and something about defending his castle.

        Thank you kind adventurer!  I heard the sound's of
your battle with Scrytin, and while he was distracted I was
able to cast a powerful spell.  You will find a magical key
on the ground here, disguised as a rock, and you will also
find that I have magically formed an exit back to my study from
here.  The key will unlock some secret floorboards, and what
you find under there will be your reward.  I must stay here
and help my countrymen from their chains.  Thank You for
what you have done.
 
                         Signed,
                                 King Relnar
