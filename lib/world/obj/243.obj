furry belt~
   These are rather strange belts.  The fur is probably from a tiger or a lion,
but why would someone make a belt from that?  This particular belt is about 2.
5 inches thick.

belt ancients ancient~
   Long thought lost and destroyed, this is a legendary piece of equipment.  It
was used thousands of years ago by a hero in the Orc Wars.  This belt grants the
wearer the ability to hit his enemies more often and with greater damage.

   More of a status symbol than a functional piece of equipment, these goggle
must have cost a fortune!  They block out sunlight just as well as a $20 pair of
sunglasses.
