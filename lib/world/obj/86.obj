journal bandit~
   I have traveled far in these last few months with little success in my
ventures.  Even now, my comrades are investigating the ruins of Kalithorn's
Keep in hopes of finding treasure or something that we can live off of for a
while.  I found a strange book today with runes such as i have never seen.  I
have copied them into this journal so that I may study them further.  I believe
they are some kind of spell that will transport me to another place in this
world, but I am unsure.
