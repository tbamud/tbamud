The implementors zone deletion policy.~
   To prevent accidentally deleting someone's zone and causing conflicting OLC
access I have made the following guide. If someone does not login to the mud
for over 6 months, and does not mudmail an implementor to let them know of a
delayed absence their zone can be deleted. I use show areas to list all zones
and then go through one by one using "last <playername>". If they have not
logged in for over 6 months I then "stat file <playername>" and check that they
have the proper OLC set, and that they do not have the NO_DEL flag. Anyone with
an excused absence MUST have the NO_DEL flag set so we will not delete their
zone. If they have not been on for 6 month2 and are not excused I then "show
zone #" to doublecheck the zone and builder assigned. I then check if they made
anything of value that should be saved. Once you are sure it is safe to delete
their zone and all their work set their OLC to -1. "stat file <playername>" to
be sure it worked and then feel free to delete away.

   "Cornucopia" comes from the Latin "cornu copiae," which translates literally
as "horn of plenty.  " A traditional staple of feasts, the cornucopia is
believed to represent the horn of a goat from Greek mythology.  According to
legend, it was from this horn that the god Zeus was fed as an infant.  Later,
the horn was filled with flowers and fruits, and given as a present to Zeus.
The filled horn (or a receptacle resembling it) has long served as a traditional
symbol in art and decoration to suggest a store of abundance.

Article I
I am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of

Article II
I will never surrender of my own free will. If in command, I will never
surrender the members of my command while they still have the means to resist.

Article III
If I am captured I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make
every effort to escape and to aid others to escape. I will accept neither
parole nor special favors from the enemy.

Article IV
If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I
will give no information or take part in any action which might be harmful to
my comrades. If I am senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the
lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them up in every way.

Article V
When questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give
name, rank, service number, and date of birth. I will evade answering
further questions to the utmost of my ability. I will make no oral or
written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to
their cause.

   Rick Husband paid tribute to fallen astronauts from space, just four days before he died.
"They made the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives and service to the country and for all
mankind," the Texas native said Jan. 28, on the 17th anniversary of the Challenger
explosion. The 45-year-old former Air Force test pilot was selected as an astronaut in 1994
on his fourth try. Space flight was his lifelong passion, along with singing. This was his
second space flight. Personal data: Married, two children.
   William McCool was an experienced Navy pilot with more than 2,800 hours in flight. But
two weeks into his first trip into space, the 41-year-old astronaut was bursting with
amazement. "There is so much more than what I ever expected," McCool told NPR on Jan. 30.
"Its beyond imagination, until you actually get up and see it and experience it and feel
it." The former Navy test pilot grew up in Lubbock, Texas, and became an astronaut in 1996.
Personal data: Married, three children.
   Michael Anderson accepted the risks of space flight willingly. "I take the risk because I
think what were doing is really important. If you look at this research flight ... the
potential yield that we have is really tremendous," he said. Anderson, 43, was born in New
York and grew up on military bases. He was flying for the Air Force when NASA chose him in
1994 as one of only a handful of black astronauts. He traveled to Russias Mir space station
in 1998. Personal data: Married.
   Kalpana Chawla wanted to design aircraft when she emigrated to the United States from
India in the 1980s. The space program was the furthest thing from her mind. But "one thing
led to another," the 41-year-old engineer said, and she was chosen as an astronaut in 1994.
Chawla was the first native of India to fly on a space shuttle but the second in space,
after Rakesh Sharma, who flew on an Indo-Soviet mission in 1984. This was Chawla's second
space flight. Personal data: Married.
   David Brown was a Navy novelty: a jet pilot as well as a doctor. He was also probably the
only NASA astronaut to have worked as a circus acrobat. (It was a summer job during
college.) He said what he learned about "the teamwork and the safety and the staying
focused" carried over to his space job. He joined the Navy after his medical internship, and
held a captain's rank. NASA chose him as an astronaut in 1996. This was the 46-year-old
Virginia native's first space flight. Personal data: Single.
   Laurel Clark was a diving medical officer aboard submarines and then a flight surgeon
before she became an astronaut in 1996. This was her first space flight. She had been on
board Columbia to help with more than 80 science experiments. "She was doing something that
she cared deeply about, that she was very good at," said her father, Robert Salton. In fact,
he said, "she was pretty good at everything." The 41-year-old's hometown was Racine, Wis.
Personal data: Married, one child.
   Ilan Ramon, a colonel in Israels air force, was the first Israeli in space. His mother
and grandmother survived the Auschwitz death camp. Like his Zionist father, the astronaut
fought for his country, in the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and the Lebanon War in 1982. He took
part in the 1981 air strike that destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor. Ramon, 48, was selected
as an astronaut in 1997 and moved to Houston in 1998 for training. He called Tel Aviv home.
Personal data: Married, four children.

christmas poem soldiers~

A poem about the forgotten soldiers christmas.~
Twas the night before Christmas,
He lived all alone,
In a one bedroom house
Made of plaster and stone.

I had come down the chimney
With presents to give,
And to see just who
In this home did live.

I looked all about,
A strange sight I did see,
No tinsel, no presents,
Not even a tree.

No stocking by mantle,
Just boots filled with sand,
On the wall hung pictures
Of far distant lands.

With medals and badges,
Awards of all kinds,
A somber thought
Came through my mind.

For this house was different,
It was dark and dreary,
I found the home of a soldier,
Once I could see clearly.

The soldier lay sleeping,
Silent, alone,
Curled up on the floor
In this one bedroon home.

The face was so gentle,
The room in such disorder,
Not how I pictured
A United States Soldier.

Was this the hero
Of whom I'd just read?
Curled up on a poncho,
The floor for a bed?

I realized the families
That I saw this night,
Owed their lives to these soldiers
Who were willing to fight.

Soon round the world,
The children would play,
And grownups would celebrate
a bright Christmas Day.

They all enjoyed freedom
Each month of the year,
Because of the soldiers,
Like the one lying here.

I couldn't help wonder
How many lay alone,
On an old Christmas Eve
In a land far from home.

The very thought
Brought a tear to my eye,
I dropped to my knees
And started to cry.

The soldier awakened
And I heard a rough voice,
"Santa don't cry,
This life is my choice;

I fight for freedom,
I don't ask for more,
My life is my GOD,
My COUNTRY, My CORPS."

The soldier rolled over
And drifted to sleep,
I couldn't control it,
I continued to weep.

I kept watch for hours,
So silent and still
And we both shivered
From the cold night's chill.

I didn't want to leave
On that cold, dark, night,
This Guardian of Honor
So willing to fight.

Then the soldier rolled over,
With a voice soft and pure,
Whispered, "Carry on Santa,
It's Christmas Day, All is secure."

One look at my watch,
And I knew he was right.
"MERRY CHRISTMAS MY FRIEND,
AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT."
