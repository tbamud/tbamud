   @RThe location of this zone is the dragonball setting of Earth and Planet
Namek.  You can be any level to enter this zone, it is just a place to have fun.
You can also be any alignment to enter my area.  The theme is of course DB DBZ
and DBGT.  And the plot of my zone is to allow people to fight in a dbz
environment, letting them just have fun killing stuff.

   @RIf you wish to travel, there is only one way.  If you go up you will find a
teleporter, and if you go down you will find a teleporter.  They both will take
you somewhere new.  @N @RTo enter either teleporter, all you have to type is
enter teleporter.  @n
