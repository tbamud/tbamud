   This dog toy barely even resembles its namesake.  The long yellow body is
elongated and several holes have been chewed into it.  Its feet and crown are a

plant mistletoe~
   The tradition of kissing under the mistletoe originated from the Druids who
considered the mistletoe sacred.  They believed that it held magical virtue and
was a remedy for evil.  The priests would cut pieces of the oak tree on which
the mistletoe grew and offer them along with two white bulls as a sacrifice to
pagan gods.  Twigs with berries were hung above doors to indicate that past
grievance and hatreds were forgiven and it was used in amulets, bracelets and
rings to ward off evil and protect against witchcraft and poisoning.  Mistletoe
symbolizes peace and love.
