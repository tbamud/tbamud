altar~
   It appears that the altar is nothing more than a loose piece of stone from
the courtyard floor or maybe one of the nearby buildings.  However, with the
black cloth that is draped over top of it and the layers of blood stains upon
it, it appears ghastly and otherwordly.

corpse~
   It looks as if it might have been alive just minutes ago.  The blood which
wells over its chest is still warm, still flowing - undried.  Its chest is torn
open, split in two.  From the amount blood and innards splayed over the corpse's
chest, it appears the heart was taken.
