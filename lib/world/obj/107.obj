iuel message board tablet~
   Ever since the sun has set upon the eastern skys, and fallen every day to a
darken reign.  Parables of Nox roam the land abound and beyond.  Strong and
mighty warriors magicicians and those of lesser known march the ground mortal
fear to thread on.  But times grew short, the wars plagued the realms and death
had flexed it's wings.  Masses and mobs killings took place.  Sacrifices of
blood and bone soaked the grounds, making it moist and hungry for more.  The
war of the immortals was at it's darkest hour.  800 years later.  The wars
ended, leaving only the fittest to survive.  These great legends were loved and
feared, their faces to be thought unworthy to look upon, by mere mortals.  
They were to be Gods and Greater Gods.  Casting the rotting and part soiled
remains of their victims into a pit and burried it far away from the town that
was built for the living.  Life soon begin to spawn by itself.  Life as it
seems cannot be stopped, and those that was once dead.  Are now known only to
be called commonly as the Undead.  In the land of Iuel this massgrave
rejuvinates it's movements and sends forth a great army of fearsome creatures.
Wrecking havoc in the city around, with skills so great, and magic so potent.
The wars between the living and the dead, has now just begun.  A place to rest,
away from the living.  They mock me, but soon they will die.  Everyone has to
die.
