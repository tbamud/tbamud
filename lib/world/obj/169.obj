and disemboweling foes, with little regard to artistic detail.  The metal has a

greyish-brown coloring of the bark.  This variety of pine is typically found in
wooded areas such as this, near mountainous regions.  You look closely, and
notice there appears to be some kind of writing, scratched into a small
barkless patch near the base of the tree.

carvings inscription patch scratch~
   The inscription is a strange series of symbols written in the language of
the gibberlings.  As you strain your eyes to try and decipher the meaning, the
words begin to glow, and a voice inside your head speaks a message: The bearer
of the tomahawk of terror has forged the fate of my tribe, if i could repay
him, I would gouge out his eyes!  Thryln'k
