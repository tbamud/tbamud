the gibberlings.  As you strain your eyes to try and decipher the meaning, the
words begin to glow, and a voice inside your head speaks a message: The bearer
of the tomahawk of terror has forged the fate of my tribe, if i could repay
him, I would gouge out his eyes!  Thryln'k

   It is a massive pine tree, apparently very old, judging by the mass and
grayish-brown coloring of the bark.  This variety of pine is typically found in
wooded areas such as this, near mountainous regions.  You look closely, and
notice there appears to be some kind of writing, scratched into a small
barkless patch near the base of the tree.
