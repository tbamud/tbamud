   |           THE STREET VENDOR FROM HELL           |
   |                   by Crazyman                   |
   |                                                 |
   |  (The play begins on a street in downtown       |
   |  New Sparta. It's about noon, and it's          |
   |  raining. Joe Smith is seated on a bench,       |
   |  along with a cop.)                             |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: Oh, how I wish it would stop raining! I   |
   |       grow weary of this foul weather.          |
   |                                                 |
   |  Cop: Actually, I like this rain. It gives me   |
   |       an excuse to sit in the 7-11 and eat      |
   |       donuts.                                   |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: Yes, you would like that.                 |
   |                                                 |
   |   (A high pitched scream pierces the silence.)  |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: What the hell was that? Is somebody       |
   |       trying to kill Abe again?                 |
   |                                                 |
   |  Cop: I don't know. I'll go check it out.       |
   |       (The cop stands up, and hurries down      |
   |       the street.)                              |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: (To himself) I think I'm heading home.    |
   |       (He gets up to leave.)                    |
   |                                                 |

   |                                                 |
   |  (A street vendor dashes out from behind a      |
   |  building, and rushes over to Joe)              |
   |                                                 |
   |  Vendor: Good afternoon good sir! May I inter-  |
   |          est you in this beautiful gold watch?  |
   |          (The vendor pulls out a gold watch     |
   |          from his pocket, obviously one of      |
   |          many.)                                 |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: Is it stolen? It doesn't matter anyway,   |
   |       I don't need another watch. Besides, I    |
   |       don't even any money right now.           |
   |                                                 |
   |  Vendor: (Snarling) Look son, I want to sell    |
   |          you this watch. It's not stolen, and   |
   |          it's only 50 coins, a very reasonable  |
   |          price.                                 |
   |                                                 |
   |  Joe: That's true, it is a reasonable price.    |
   |       My answer is still no.                    |
   |                                                 |
   |  Vendor: Ok, this is what I'm going to do. (He  |
   |          reaches inside his coat and pulls      |
   |          out a switchblade.) You're going to    |
   |          buy this watch, or I'll cut you        |
   |          bitch. I've got 5 kids to feed.        |

   |                                                 |

   |          knife, cutting him in the arm.)        |
   |                                                 |

   |                                                 |

   |          sorry you didn't buy this from me.     |
   |          (He puts the watch away, and pulls out |
   |          a handgun. He cocks the trigger, and   |
   |          points it at Joe's chest.)             |

   |          trigger, and the bullet rips through)  |
   |          Joe's body.)                           |
