Welcor guardian~
   The statue is a guardian to this shine, it depicts one of the immortals of
TBA and the influence of Justice to all who worship here.  He/She stands clad in
a long flowing set of robes and he/she carries a warhammer in their hand.  The
feeling of peace overwhelms the senses when you look at the statue that seems to
be floating and glowing brightly.
