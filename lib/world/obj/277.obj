blue bodice~
   Lightly embroidered with silver thread, this blue bodice is made of a very
soft and smooth material, that nonetheless is strong enough to cinch the waist
tightly, laced with several silver cords at the back.

wooden crate~
   Made of damp and mouldy wooden boards, this crate looks more likely to fall
apart than be of any use in containing its contents.  A layer of dust and
cobwebs covers the grimey surface, as if this box has been left untouched for a
long time.

string black pearls~
   Darkly beautiful, these smooth black pearls are linked with a fine silver
cord that spirals elegantly around each one.  A strange sinister feeling seems
to emanate from them, as though they once belonged to a powerfully evil owner.

treasure chest~
   This strong wooden chest is bound with thick metal bands, keeping the
contents safely protected from all but the owner of the key.  Slight blue and
green streaks marr the beauty of its design, growths of mould and fungus
beginning to flourish on the dark, damp wooden surface.

paladin's bejewelled shield~
   This shield is inscribed with the name of Paladin Took II, and seems to be
the shield that would have been used against Lotho in the Battle of Bywater.  
Gilded with gold and silver, several precious gems are studded here and there,
rubies, sapphires, and emeralds all testifying to the wealth and pride of the
owner.

old skeleton~
   This intact pile of bones is obviously the long decayed form of a hobbit,
seeming proof that murder exists even amongst these normally peace-loving
people.  There is no telling how long this skeleton has been here, although the
thick layer of dust seems to indicate many years.
