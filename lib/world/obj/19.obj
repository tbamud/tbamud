spider's fang~
   This long, wickedly curving pincer is that of a giant spider.  Jet-black and
smooth to the touch, it feels slightly wet and glistens as though freshly hewn.
The tip is intensely sharp and tiny spikes of hair barb their way down the
length, making this fang extraordinarily painful to remove once embedded.

long sticky flesh albino frog's tongue~
   This long strip of flesh looks to be the sickly pink tongue of an albino
frog.  This creature is increasingly rare, due to high demand for various parts
of its anatomy, most of which are rumoured to have powerful magical properties.

An old leather book gathers dust here.~

   Having spent considerable time studying the inhabitants of the place they 
call the Spider Swamp and the powerful magicks they possess, I have 
decided to preserve my findings in writing. Each of these volumes is 
dedicated to Tyrel the Machine-Maker, who was a brilliant colleague and 
great friend. Alas, both he and his devices are lost to the Drow lord who 
rules this place, and so the method of creating these potions is no more.
Nonetheless, I lay it out here for any who would continue these studies.

   A powerful potion of strength was our first discovery, a deep red potion, 
the colour of rich wine. When quaffed, it produced immediate physical 
effects, muscle ability enhanced and body defences strengthened.

   As a base for all our testings, we used the nightblood of the driders, black 
viscous fluid that burns the eyes unless contained in special beakers. Then, 
for this particular solution we added an arachnoid fang, from a striped spider 
it was. Finally, one of the eggs from the lizard man tribe. All of these 
ingredients were gained with great peril, and once mixed together in Tyrel's 
machine, produced a solution so potent that we were forced to create special
magical vials to hold it. The effects, though temporary, are nonetheless 
astounding.

   These findings are the work of myself - Artemis, of gnome-kind, and Tyrel, 
a man and machine-maker. Use them wisely.

   A powerful potion of magic was our second discovery, a deep blue potion, 
the colour of a clear sky. When quaffed, it produced immediate magical 
effects, enhanced mental ability and casting endurance.

   As a base for all our testings, we used the nightblood of the driders, black 
viscous fluid that burns the eyes unless contained in special beakers. Then, 
for this particular solution we added an arachnoid gland, from the spider that squirts. Finally, a tongue from the local species of white frog. All of these 
ingredients were gained with great peril, and once mixed together in Tyrel's 
machine, produced a solution so potent that we were forced to create special
magical vials to hold it. The effects, though temporary, are nonetheless

   A powerful potion of agility was our third discovery, a bright green potion, 
the colour of fresh grass. When quaffed, it produced immediate changes to
speed and agility, improving endurance in travel.

   As a base for all our testings, we used the nightblood of the driders, black 
viscous fluid that burns the eyes unless contained in special beakers. Then, 
for this particular solution we added an arachnoid fur, from a spider that was 
purple in colour. Finally, one of the salty plant growths that flourish here. 
All these ingredients were gained with great peril, and once mixed together in 
Tyrel's machine, produced a solution so potent that we were forced to create 
special magic vials to hold it. The effects, though temporary, are nonetheless

   This long section of beautiful shimmering fur must have once adorned a very
elegant creature indeed, perhaps a black panther judging by the smooth glossy
appearance of the fur and incredibly soft dark texture of its leathery interior.
Cut into a simple shape and crudely hemmed, it has been fashioned into a sort of
robe, though the poor quality of the stitching somewhat marrs the incredible
beauty of the fur itself.
