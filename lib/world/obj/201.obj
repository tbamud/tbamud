sword meridianus oceana~
   Engraved on this sacred blade is the name of the sword.  Forged by a
competant and highly skilled blacksmith and enchanted by an adept and powerful
sorceror, this blade holds the potential to create HORRENDOUS amount of damage.
The blade itself is made of a bluish metal, yet it cannot be determined for the
tones of blue are always changing.  You may say the blade itself is made of a
solid type of flowing liquid, while the hilt has been creatively designed to
form the shape of Leviathan, the legendary dragon that sleeps beneath the ocean.
@W@uTo Use this blade:@n At the expense of 50 mana points, this blade will
constantly heal you for 10 hp every 2-3 seconds.  To use this command, type
@BEXECUTE FUSION@n.  For 100 of your own hp you can damage the opponent for 1000
in return, provided that it is not a player character.  A drawback to this
ability is the time taken to fully execute the damage, it takes time to recharge
before striking down the opponent.  To use this type @BPERFORM AURORAFALL@n.

SECRETS
   There are a list of things that will not appear anywhere on this zone.  They
are for immortals only ;) Type olist to bring out a list of them.  Items
classified under this will be those with VNUM 20170+.  Load them and enjoy.

QUESTS
   A power sword can be obtained by braving the deep waters (move far away from
the island) and wait.  Then go north, and SEARCH around.  Finally say the words
'liquiddreams' and receive this magnificent blade!
   The Old Fool in the old hut may seem to be talking rubbish, but they are
actually clues to the words liquiddreams ;)

   Special commands like dive and dig can be performed at the places where they
say you can do so.

3~
   FEATURES
   Wildlife: Crabs and seagull sleep at night, if you like watching these
creatures you may want to observe them from day till night.

   Prism: The old fool will offer to make prism equipments for you.  Simple DIG
around for a few prism shards of shells and greet him to get a list of
instructions.

   Danger: Although Konolua beach may seem peaceful on the outside, GUYS
especially should keep a look out for the siren and be wary of them.  Their
voices can stun you!
   Deep waters should also be avoided, if you don't want to drown.
