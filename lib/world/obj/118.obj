opening to oblivion itself.  Around it, the vivid blue iris provides a startling

realistic eyeball indeed.  A strange shimmering cover of darkness envelops the
entire eye, making it possible for a holder to 'open' or 'close' it.

of dust coating its nonetheless exceptionally beautiful wooden structure.  
There are many rooms to this house, some bright and large whilst others are
darker and drearier, here cobwebs flutter in the corner, and here glorious
miniature paintings decorate a grand display room.  There are three levels to
the house, and each seems rather peculiarly to be an independantly designed
structure of its own.  Tiny pieces of furniture are scattered here and there,
realistically placed as though a tiny family actually lived here.  In fact,
there is an unusual aura around this little house, a slight chill in the dusky
air surrounding it, and an almost imperceptible murmuring sound of talking,
laughing, crying; all echoing faintly within the miniature rooms and halls as if
tiny ghosts wandered amongst them.

   These large, open eyes are bright blue in colour, and slide slowly about as

they seem to perceive things beyond the normal realm.

been stained a deep oil black.  Though the key is somewhat old and damaged, it
still looks usable, angry slashes carved apparently deliberately into its

seen, though one has been worn away.

gaze of a predator.

imparts only pain instead of nourishment.
