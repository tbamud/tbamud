of dust coating its nonetheless exceptionally beautiful wooden structure.
There are many rooms to this house, some bright and large whilst others are
darker and drearier, here cobwebs flutter in the corner, and here glorious
miniature paintings decorate a grand display room.  There are three levels to
the house, and each seems rather peculiarly to be an independantly designed
structure of its own.  Tiny pieces of furniture are scattered here and there,
realistically placed as though a tiny family actually lived here.  In fact,
there is an unusual aura around this little house, a slight chill in the dusky
air surrounding it, and an almost imperceptible murmuring sound of talking,
laughing, crying; all echoing faintly within the miniature rooms and halls as if
tiny ghosts wandered amongst them.

pair eyes~
   These large, open eyes are bright blue in color, and slide slowly about as
if still attached to some living creature.  Unblinking and strangely piercing,
they seem to perceive things beyond the normal realm.

been stained a deep oil black.  Though the key is somewhat old and damaged, it
still looks usable, angry slashes carved apparently deliberately into its
length.  A word has been crudely etched into the handle, the letters S E can be
seen, though one has been worn away.
