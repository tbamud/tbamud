   AUTO's.  @RAutoSac @nwill allow you to sacarifice corpses of mobs that you
defeat.  @RAutoLoot @ngives you the ability to take all the items from a corpse
of a mob you defeat (this will work before the autosac).  @RAutogold @ntakes
only the gold from the defeated mobs.  Autoloot overrides autogold, so you will
still take items.  @RAutosplit @nwill split your gold from a defeated mob and
disperse it to all the people within your group.  All these commands are
toggles, so you can turn them on or off at will.  Type @RTOGGLE @nto see all
the available toggles that you can turn on or off.

   @RWimpy @nis a safety command that lets you flee from combat if you go below
the set wimpy.  For example if you type wimpy 10 you will flee from combat if
you fall below 10 hitpoints.  Flee is not guaranteed.  You can fail from
fleeing, but it will continue to flee if possible.  Make sure you keep an eye
on your hitpoints.  A scroll of Recall will save you if you feel your wimpy
won't.

   You can regain hitpoints, mana points, and movement points by @RSleeping
@nand @Rresting.  @n Sleeping is exactly as it states, you fall asleep, you can
still check your stats and listen to Gossips, group talks, view the Who list
and simple commands.  Resting allows you to sit down, you can listen to talk,
as well as all other channels that you belong to.  You can also do more
commands that sleeping will not allow you to do, but some commands require you
to be standing.  Resting does not heal hitpoints as fast as sleeping, but will
restore movement points just as fast.  Being Drunk and sleeping increases the
Rate of Mana point rejuvenation.

   The sand sticks to the bottom of your feet and smells metallic.  The sand is
scattered and piled in various ways as if people have struggled in a fight
here.

   The sand covers a few dismembered body parts.  A few bleached white bones
stick out a odd angles as if someone was trying to create a design.  They seem
to have failed.

   The ground here is sandy, but very firm.  You can hear the sound of water to
the south west.  The sand seems to give way to a more solid rock floor that
slopes up.

shape than the rest of the Arena.  How odd.

water level barely covers the bottom of your feet.  You can see some ripples
forming in the southwest.

   Crunch, Crunch, Crunch.  You cannot take a step without stepping on some
bones.  The bones break everytime you step on them.  Some of these bones seem
to have been here for a very long time.  Some of them are beneath the large
rocks that occupy this space also.

   The beach and the rocks merge together here.  You can see that the rocks
form a breaking point for the water.  During a high tide, the water seems to
come up to this point.  Hopefully you won't be in the middle of combat when it
rises.

to believe that there must be something alive in here.  You hear an odd noise.

   There seems to be a lot of grass growing here.  The water comes right up to
the grass, but does not seem to drown the grass.  The grass however has been
trampled on, many of times.  This is a good sign that something lives around
here.  You see a large rope dangling from the ceiling.  It looks strong enough
to support you.

through the wall.  It is as if someone forgot to finish building in here.  
None the less, this room has 3 other exits and is big enough to be in combat.
