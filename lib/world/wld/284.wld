A barrow mound.~
   You are standing atop a barrow mound which is about 15 feet in diameter.
There is no vegetation inside the circle, strangely enough.  A low cumulous of
swirling mist engulfs you from the knees down, making it look as though you are
partially buried.

City limits of Ghenna.~
   You are standing inside the city limits of Ghenna.  Once a booming barter
town, it is now a haven for the evil which it bred over long years under the
rule of the hubristic Lord Suzerain.  In virtually every corner you see ruins
of some sort or another intermingled with old, age-whitened bones from all
manner of beasts.  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

A fountain of tears.~
   A large fountain containing the tears of those slain within the city limits
has been erected here, abutting the east wall of the city - it looks quite deep
and wide.  The water is a crystaline blue which exudes holiness, something
quite strange for such an evil city.  Exits lead West, North and South.

The smell of death.~
   You are standing in what appears to be the town graveyard.  Nobody feels the
need to bury the dead, so the corpses are just strewn about in no particular
order.  And the smell, oh boy!  It's all you can do to keep from losing your
lunch right now.  The corpses are stacked too high to exit East, but you can
pass North, South or West.

The realm of the hopeless.~
   The incessant wailing of souls in torment causes visible shivers up and down
your spine.  The walls, floor and ceiling are a viscous, blood-red mass that
eludes description.  A rift in the ceiling above you causes a slight breeze to
ruffle your hair.  A magic portal stands south, leading into the unknown.

To stay here long would surely mean the end of you.

north which seems to be moving somehow.  Next to the bar a stairwell disappears
into blackness above.  The ceiling is vaulted, and sports three candeled
chandeliers, which hang like victims above you.

sturdy, the bar is very pliant to the touch, and it seems to be MOVING ever so
slightly, as if it were ALIVE!  A stairwell is here, leading upwards into

here.  It looks as though the flesh was eaten off of their living bodies as
they writhed in agony.  The stream of blood you witnessed at the entrance is
much larger here, apparently you are onto something.

Lair entrance.~
   This is an arched cavern of great size - it looks like the Houston
astrodome.  A great ledge of rock juts out above your head, showering you with
a steady gush of blood and entrails.  A raucous sound of crunching viscera,
intermingled with a slurp here and there, turns your stomach.  Then you hear
it...  An encouraging voice which keeps repeating "Yes, yes, thats it...  Just
a few steps more...  You're almost there.  "

   This ledge is slippery with the blood of hundreds of vanquished adventurers
who made the mistake of entering here.  Corpses, corpses, everywhere.  At least
you finally found the source of that horrific sulfur smell.  A black, steaming
substance is smeared all over the walls emitting the funk.  As if this werent
bad enough, you suddenly have the feeling that your life is about to end soon.

A cramped grotto.~
   You are in a cramped grotto over the cave entrance.  Even if you arent
claustrophobic this place can surely make you that way.  A crawlspace leads
West.  Watch your head.

Stalagmites and stalactites alike jut from the floor and ceiling.  There are
exits East, North and West.

Abode of the Efreeti.~
   You have entered the magical abode of the great Efreeti.  Done in an eastern
motif, this room glimmers with all the amenities one could want.  Pillows, rugs
and candelabra are everywhere.  This definitely looks like the lap of luxury.
To the North lies the forbidden treasure room, to enter it is to ask for
certain death.

of course, North, back the way you came.  The cavern is vaulted, looming about
25 feet over your head...  Looks pretty dark up there.

An east-west tunnel.~
   This tunnel is only about 5 feet high, much to your chagrin.  Moss- like
lichens hang from the ceiling, brushing past your face from time to time.  The
tunnel continues East and West.

An east-west tunnel.~
   This cramped little tunnel dead ends here at a huge boulder.  The only
apparent exit seems to be back the way you came.

A wide tunnel.~
   This tunnel is a little broader, and easier to maneuver in.  However, you
have become confused...  Which way is which?  There is a hole in the wall to
the North, and another path leads South.

Crawlspace.~
   You crawl into the hole, which is infested with bugs that crunch under your
weight - GROSS!  You can continue Southward this way, if the bugs dont bother
you too much, or you can back out into the tunnel to the North.

Crawlspace.~
   The crawlspace opens up into a 10 foot square room filled with all manner of
insects, most of them HUGE.  Hope you aren't arachnophobic, cause if you are,
this place would surely scare you to death.  Exits lead in all cardinal
directions.

A quivering jaunt.~
   You have entered a quivering jaunt.  It feels like you are in the belly of a
giant beast.  The mucuslike walls are a deep red color that thrums with energy.
The only exit is North.

A quivering jaunt.~
   This room moves so much that you have a hard time keeping your feet.  The
red mucus is hanging from the walls and ceiling in tenebrous strings that look
quite sickening.  A dark spot on the West wall hints at the only possible exit.

The lair of the Deepspawn.~
   You have entered a 20 foot square opening that appears to be a lair of some
sort.  Bones lie strewn about in every corner - most of them appear to be human
bones.  A big pile of treasure sits in the center of the room covered with the
red mucus that lines the walls here.  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.

A dead end.~
   The street dead ends here in a twisted mass of brambles.  A high city wall
looms over you to the West.  It seems the only exit is North.
