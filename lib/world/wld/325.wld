Matted-down Grass~
   The yellow grass here has been trampled through, most of it smooshed to the
ground from passing feet and wagon wheels.  The tracks lead south toward an open
area where a fairly large number of people are milling about.  Just south of
here are a couple of wagons pulled up close by the side of the road.

Matted-down Grass~
   The way is fairly well traveled for not being a road, the amount of traffic
which has headed in this direction has made the way very passable.  Just to the
east is a colorful wagon with a man sitting inside, waving at you.

A Beaten Grassy Path~
   Another wagon sits beside the road, this one just to the west side.  The
grasses have been walked upon so much here that there are patches where it has
been completely worn away.  Directly south from here is a huge, wide open area
where large numbers of odd looking men and women dance, cavort and tease their
way through the people who walk through the area.

who decided they didn't want it anymore.

   Looking about this wagon's small interior room, it is easy to mistake it for
an abandoned wagon.  Everything in this wagon is very old and rotted, the smell
of the place is enough to make most seasoned fair-goers turn tail.  And that is
saying a lot.  A small, round table sits in the center of the room, a glowing

Beaten Trail~
   The sound of the running water is much clearer now, it is not the sound of a
great amount of water, just the twinkling of a stream.  There is a way through
the forest to the north, east and south.

Forest Trail~
   The path leads east into a small clearing where people can be seen moving
about.  Structures of some sort have been erected or placed there as well.  The
way back to the festival grounds lies to the west.

Forest Trail~
   This trail looks almost like it may have been a deer run or something before
the gypsies came through.  Possibly they parked their many wagons and tents here
for just that reason, in hopes of catching a little bit of dinner.  The wagons
and tents lie to east surrounding a clearing in the woods.

Open Clearing~
   Trees ring this small clearing, tents and wagons set up just at the edge of
the treeline.  A huge bonfire burns in the center where most of the people who
sleep in this area lounge during their breaks or late at night when the
festivities have slowed a bit.

Wagon~
   This covered wagon holds a rough area of wood planking that is at this time
very empty save for a small pad of blankets to sleep in.  The top is made of a
strong fabric that keeps rain from falling into the interior with flaps at both
ends that can tie closed for privacy.

Tent~
   This small tent looks to have been hastily erected with no real regard for

Teepee~
   There is another small firepit in this dwelling, the top of which allows
smoke to drift out and into the air above.  This looks like it would sleep a
good six or so people comfortably - and from the number of blankets strewn about
the ground, that number is pretty accurate.

Side Stage Left~
   This is where the actors exit the stage, where they rest a bit or have a
drink from the ale tent before resuming a part or heading to their home for the
night.  The stage itself lies just to the north.

Side Stage Right~
   This is the area where the actors and actresses prepare for their time on the
stage, rehearsing lines or simply waiting quietly.  A lot of nervous titter and
adjustment of costume goes on here before the scenes are enacted.

At the Riverbank~
   A small brook flows by over the smooth rocks in its bed.  Its deepest point
could not be more than three or four feet, it couldnt be any wider than eight
feet.  The sounds of the water is very soothing, this is the sort of place to
inspire works of art.

In the Brook~
   Well, your feet have certainly gotten wet now!  The water is cold and clear
and certainly good enough to drink.  The forest path lies to the north.

The Bard's Stump~
   The way is impassable in any direction except that which you came from,
however the stump of the huge oak that rests in this space appears to be one
heck of a place to rest for a spell, or even for the night.

The Storyteller's Stump~
   This small area is where, at the top of every hour, a new tale is told to the
children (and adults in many cases) who gather around the Stump to hear a tale
spun from the Great Tome of Adventures.  Wide-eyed and completely quiet as they
sit enraptured, the children chew their bottom lips, exchange frightened or
excited looks - but never leave until the end.
