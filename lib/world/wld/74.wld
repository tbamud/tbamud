The Graveyard~
   This room is surrounded by seemless walls with no apparent entrance or exit.
It is strangely comfortable, neither too warm nor to cold and lit by a sort of
eerie phosphorescent light that emanates from the walls themselves.  The
surface of floor, walls, and ceiling hum vibrantly, resounding with the sounds
of deep earth.

A Bend in the Path~
   The white cobbled path bends gracefully here, leading either north or east.
A large willow tree grows just off the path, dripping slender limbs and soft
white blossoms on to the grass.  Yet another large bed of hyacinths grows
around the base of the willow, lending its scent to the sweetness of the willow
blossoms.  The very air is charged with energy and serenity.

was planted atop the grave of a great and powerful druid and stands here as
sentinel to her memory.

The Mourners Path~
   This path is as pointedly cared for as any other in the city, and includes
clusters of drooping white hyacinths.  Soft white cobbles have been trod into
the ground to create this functional and beautiful pathway.  A large clump of
flowers has been uprooted violently, leaving a shallow hole in the dirt near
the path.  A few dismembered hyacinth petals litter the ground near the hole.
A hole has been dug in the ground here.

   A tall set of iron-worked gates stand here, open to the populace.
Intricate in design and strong of structure, this gate looks adequate enough at
keeping people out when closed and locked.  The round, cobbled path ends here,
leaving visitors to tread on the lawn while visiting the cemetary.

Within the Graveyard~
   The graveyard is well-maintained and clean of litter with an immaculate
expanse of grass punctuated by tombstones and intricate marble sculptures.
The graveyard seems to be separated into lanes where mourners and
groundskeepers can easily access all the plots without disturbing the graves
themselves.  Far to the east, you can just make out the roof of a large, marble
mausoleum.

   These plots are the final resting places to working men and women buried
alone.  The tombstones are mostly standard marble or granite squares with no
more than a name carved into it.  These look to be rather new in comparison to
some of the larger and more elaborate grave markers to the north.  One grave
lies open and waiting to be filled, its tombstone unmarked as of yet.

The Pyre~
   Not every culture considers burial proper treatment of a loved one's
remains.  Here is where bodies are stacked on a pyre of pine or cedar and
burned to ash.  Supposedly, burning the body allows easy transition for the
spirit, releasing it from the body.  The grass here is burned to black ash, but
the area immediately surrounding it is carpetted with lush greenery and clumps
of sweet-smelling flowers.
