Entering the Guild Area~
   As you enter the Guild Area, you notice an immediate change from the street
just east of you.  The air seems charged with magic and friction.  It makes your
palms want to sweat, makes your pulse race.  All the hubbub and noise from the
city has been swallowed up by the tall gray walled buildings which now surround
you.  You may continue west into the guild area or head east back into the
business district.

Guild Area~
   North Street continues to run west into the Guild Area, the strange feeling
of power and vitality washing over you strong as ever.  A huge stone edifice
rises to your south, one which must be at least four stories in height.  To the
east, the street heads toward the business district.

Dead End to North Street~
   North Street ends here, however two alleys run off to the north and south.
To the north, the alley seems a bit small, the way a bit tight.  To the south,
the alley is almost the same width as North Street.

Mage Area~
   You have entered into the Mage's Area, where the air itself crackles with
arcane energies, the forces of good and evil magic strongly at work here.  You
may continue further into the Mage Area or go south, leaving it.  To the east
and west are low stone buildings, no signs of any sort proclaiming their
function.

The feeling of power and strength still eminates all around you, lightening your
step just a bit.  A very tight little alley heads west from here, almost
unnoticable to the naked eye.  Gray stone buildings match the gray stone street
you walk upon, all in contrast to the wonderful feeling of power all around you.

aloud.

upon.  Looking west, all you can see is the beautiful shoreline following the
curve of the Cove which the town is nestled in.  To the south is a large tree
with a board of some sort affixed to it, and to the east leads the way back into
the main Guild Area.

Rangers in McGintey Cove.  This tree looks as if it may be as old as the world

one of it's branches in the upper reaches is easily as big as your waist and

another road.  To the west it only gets darker, looking quite unappealing.

Thieven Weaponsmith~
   This is a pathetically small workroom - dimly lit, grimy as hell, and reeking
of beer.  A small, wiry man works here with a sanding stone and a small bladed
knife of which you've never before seen the like.  At first the you think the
man doesn't notice you standing here in his little hole, but after a short time
he glances up and asks in a quiet, deadly voice if there is anything you need.

which is made of brick and covered in scrawlings from the many thieves who

   This room, set in the back room of looks to have been a small warehouse at
one time, is the resting and training place of the Thieves in McGintey Cove.
Cots are thrown haphazardly in all corners of this room.  Obviously, many of the
thieves in McGintey Cove cannot afford their own homes and bunk here instead.
Better watch your wallet, some sneaky associate of yours just may decide to try
some 'practice training' on it.

   This small, darkened room gives you the foreboding feeling that you are
surrounded by enemies.  As you get deeper into the room, you feel the fabric of
someone's sleeve brush you.  Whirling around and grabbing the sleeve, you
realize it is an empty jacket hanging on a hook.  Feeling your way around the
room, you find that there are wearables hanging all around.  A low voice rumbles
out of the darkness.

   This wide promenade, so named for the guild area it traverses, looks to be a
well used street.  To the north is a very loud, very bawdy tavern.  A sign out
front proclaims it 'The Broken Spleen'.  To the south is a huge building which
looks to be off-limits, except to particular clientele.  Two well muscled
guardsmen stand on either side of the door leading into the building, arms
crossed.  To the east the road continues, leading the way to a HUGE building,
one who's girth you can only imagine, being that you can only see a fraction of
it from between the buildings you currently stand between.  West is the way out
of the Warrior Guild's area into the West Alley.

board room for the Warrior Guild in McGintey Cove.  Very atypical of this class,
the men and women who congregate here seem almost nervous as they stretch out or
concentrate on whatever skills they will be attempting to learn in the arena
which is the Warrior's Guild in this town.  Just south of you is the guild room,
north is the exit to the outside.

   Your first thought as you enter into this building is that if ever it has
been cleaned, it wasn't anytime during this last year.  Your second thought is
that you had best duck, as a chair goes flying past your head, just inches from
your right ear!  This flying chair is, of course, accompanied by drunken
laughter and calls of 'Newbie!  ' and 'Incoming!  '.  This chair throwing must
be a ritual here at the Broken Spleen.  How quaint.  The exit is just south of

that is not only maintained, but cheerful as well.  The cobblestones which line
the path are scrubbed almost white, the walls of the buildings white stucco.
You feel that even someone who is not a cleric may be drawn to this part of the
district just to escape the gray monotony everywhere else.

Obviously the clerics who belong to this guild take great pride in their place
here in McGintey Cove.  Just north of you is a large marble temple with huge
oaken double doors in front.  This temple must be the main guild housing for
this guild.  The path heads west into more of the cleric's area or east out into

Books of the Gods~
   Small wooden bookshelves line the east, west, and south walls of this room,
all spotlessly clean and filled with books of all shapes and sizes.

Holy Weapons~
   Although physical battle is not condoned by the guild, it is realized that in
this day and age every man or woman must need defend themselves at some time or
another.  Hence this small shop dedicated to those weapons deemed fit to be
wield by a cleric in Dibrova.

West Alley~
   The alley heads north deep into the guild area for McGintey Cove, the gray
walls of guild-owned buildings surrounding the way ahead.  To the south is the
intersection of the Alley and South St, the road leading east into the business
district of McGintey Cove.

South Street~
   You stand at the intersection of West Alley and South Street.  To the north
is the dark, gray walled alley which heads deep into the guild area.  East, the
way gets a bit lighter as it heads it's way back toward the main business
district of McGintey Cove.  To the south the alley heads into a shadowed
section, one which must be the Assassin's Guild area.

West Alley~
   Although still technically in the West Alley, you are in the area of town
owned by the Deathknight's guild.  Good advice would be to watch your step
around these deadly beings.  To the west is a tall, slender door leading into
the main guild room, where deathknights practice to advance themselves.  To the
east is a door leading into a very small building, one which gives you a
decidedly uneasy feeling.  South is the end of West Alley and north leads the
way out of the Deathknight's Guild.

Deathknight's Board Room~
   This small, dark room affords a few low divines for the reclining comfort of
those who wish to relax in the comfort of their guild.  Glass display cases hold
an array of weapons along the walls, many of which considered antique by today's
standards of assassination.  To the west is the entrance to the training and
advancement room.  East leads out to West Alley.

south.  The alley heads north.  Watch your step.

Paladin Row~
   The whole area strikes you as clean and well-organized as soon as you enter.
With all the gray building and their lack of color out in the main guild area,
this place is a stark contrast indeed.  The alley continues west, with a door to
the north leading into a small tavern.

   The street, now completely enclosed on the north and south side by gray stone
walls of guild buildings, leads west to an intersection of some sort, or east
out into the main business district of McGintey Cove.

South Street~
   The street heads west into the darkened guild area of McGintey, where it
seems the very air around it carckles with mystical energy and magic.  To the
east is the main business district of McGintey Cove.  A small, unobtrusive alley
leads south from here.

South Street~
   The high traffic business area to the east seems almost a memory only as you
enter into this entirely different section of town.  The wide open expanse that
was typical of the bazaar and the main streets of town are replaced by tight
streets with stone walled buildings to either side.

West Alley~
   The alley continues to run north and south from here, the gray, dismal walls
surrounding it unending.  To the east is a wide stretch of cobbled street that
looks a bit more well travelled than any any of the previous offshoots from this
alley.

Paladin Row~
   Nothing.  The alley ends just west of here at the entrance to the Guild
itself.  It appears that a small area in front of the guild has been set up as a
resting spot for paladins who wish to rest their feet after a day of saving
innocent women and children.

Paladin Court~
   This comfortable cobblestoned court hosts a small array of comfortable chairs
and low tables, all for resting and relaxing upon before heading back out into
the wilds of Dibrova.  To the west is the entrance to the Guild, south is a
weapon shop and north is an armor shop.  Both shops are maintained by the Guild
and specialize in Paladin equipment.

   This is a small hallway leading into the main Audience Hall for the Paladin's
Guild where the Master grants level gain by virtue of experience in the field.
A bulleltin board has been posted on the south wall, a small writing implement
attached so that anyone who wishes to may post a message to their fellow
clannies.

Paladin Guild Hall~
   This hall is what is considered to be the oldest structure existing on the
rock that is McGintey Cove today.  It is said that upon this very spot, Amos
McGintey erected his temporary hideout when hiding from the Ionian Knights who
plagued the seas back in his day.  Now this ancient has been converted into a
place of respect and devotion where Paladins may increase their level if so
desired.

   Cloaks and armor, boots and gauntlets all are arrayed in this clean and
bright room.  The colors of the wearables are all vibrant and catching to the
eye, signifying the pride of the Paladin and what the class stands for in a
world ridden with evil and pestilence.

Weapons of Honor~
   This wide open area serves as both a smithy for the Guild and a shop where
class members may purchase the fine weapons produced here.  Paladins, being a
very meticulous and demanding class, prefer to make and enchant their own
weapons rather than import weapons from the dwarven craftsmen or magus weavers.
Browse these fine weapons, but remember - they are not cheap.

A Quiet Back Street~
   The sounds of the bazaar, the hustle and bustle of all the city-goers all
seems to get swallowed up by the walls of this alley.  You feel a bit of peace,
your body begins to relax a bit as you begin down this alley.  You can see that
it ends just south of here at a small door.

End of a Quiet Back Street~
   You stand before a small door, a very unmentionable place if not for the man
standing just to side of it - as if guarding it.  Strange that all sounds of the
city have completely vanished now, though you know that you have no travelled
that far from the main section.

tutoring his disciples.  The Board for your clan is mounted here - any messages
you wish to pass along can be passed via this board.
