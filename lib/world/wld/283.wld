Up a Twisting Path~
   This is a small, rocky path which looks to be heading up the mountain.  The
mountain stands high above you, and you have no knowledge of what lies at the
end of the path.  It is a very stormy night, with rain pouring down and
lightning striking in the distance.  Thunder claps and booms as you head up the
path hoping for a place to stay until the storm passes over.

   Haunted House
**********************************
This is a zone of a haunted house.  I would first just like to say that I would
like everybody to download this. This was the first successful zone done
offline by me. I really liked doing this zone even though it was hard work.

This zone was created for high level players or for groups of players. It's an
evil-aligned zone totally. It's a small zone, but hey, what can I say. It's a
house type zone. I tried to make it as large as I could. It's a hard zone, but
in return for being hard it has great objects and good mobs to fight. It has no
special spec procs or no spells used other than the ones that come with circle.
I did that so that no one would have to waste their time changing it back,
because I know that most people hate doing that:). There are two good places to
connect this zone to your mud.  The use of both spots is suggested.

Total...Rooms: 62    Objects: 34     Mobiles: 23

If you have any questions, comments, typos, or anything else I will be glad to
hear from you. You can reach me at: Maddog@@prolog.net
Thank you and enjoy my zone:)           Matt

Farther Up the Mountain~
   This path is getting muddier than ever!  You are now running through mud
puddles, and places where the path is practically gone.  By now all of your
clothes are soaked, and most of your legs are all muddy.  Ewwwwwwwwwwww!!  If
you don't get somewhere soon, you're going to catch a cold!

At the Top of the Mountain~
   Finally you are standing high above the ground, on top of the dreaded
mountain in the pouring rain.  Up ahead looks to be an old house, and by now,
you don't care what kind of shelter you seek.  You begin sprinting to the front
door, exhausted from traveling up the long path, and soaked with mud.
Suddenly, lightning strikes only a few feet away from where you were.
Unprepared, you almost fall to the mud.  Now you are running as fast as one can
go.

open the door, or not.  This house looks to be centuries old, as the porch that
you walk on is creaking with every step, and the shudders and the walls look
chipped, and just bent out of shape.  Well, going inside would be better than
staying out here in the rain all night, wouldn't it?

   You are inside of the very dark and damp old house, which is frightening you
very much now.  Noises appear from nowhere, and small shadows lurk on the
walls.  Rodent problem, maybe.  Every so often lightning strikes and lights up
the house for a split second, and then the thunder booms loudly.

The Beginning of a Hallway~
   This area is beginning to grow smaller, and smaller, until finally the
ceiling is right above your head.  This is a small tunnel-like hallway leading
east to somewhere.  It is very dark in here, and if you look back you can
barely catch a glimpse of the quick flashes of light flickering through the
windows.  The hallway leads farther east.

torch burning on the wall.  The torch is bright enough to just be able to see
the tunnel, and what you see amazes you.  The tunnel is rounded at the top,
with dirt as the ground.  Bugs and other living things crawl all around inside
of the tunnel, bothering you to the point where you're going crazy.

A Room in the House~
   The floor boards creak and groan as you pass over them.  The room is covered
in dust and cobwebs.  The walls are stained and rotting.  The ceiling and floor
look ready to collapse.  The creaking and groaning seems to be escalating
towards snapping and cracking.

A Room~
   As you walk into the room you can sense the evil.  It is totally dark inside
here, and you can just see with the light you have.  There is a bed laying
turned over in the corner, and boxes have been thrown in another.  The walls
are scratched up like some animal went through here.  A sword sticks into the
wall nearest you.

Nearing the End of the Hall~
   You are now walking through this hallway, nearing the end of it which is now
south of you a little bit.  There are no doors anywhere in this part of the
hallway, but the ones north look pretty interesting.  South is the end of the
hallway.

the north if you feel like exploring them again, and a closet lies to the south
with a small door closed.  More stairs are to the east, climbing way up to the
attic.

up.  They look very unstable, like they would break at any moment.  Other than
that this room is bare.

Inside the Attic~
   You are inside of the attic on the third floor of the house.  You REALLY
wouldn't like to find out how old and unstable the wooden boards are up this
high.  The attic has lots of old junk in it, mostly covered in old white
sheets, some of them torn.  Spider webs drape the corners of the rooms and hang
over some of the stuff laying around.

On the Roof~
   You are now on the roof of the old house.  The attic must have had a secret
passage leading out here.  The night is still very stormy, as you try to walk
as carefully as you can without fatally falling off.  That might hurt a little,
don't you agree?

Walking the Roof~
   This is another part of the roof of the house.  The wind makes you feel like
you are going to be picked up and thrown into the ground at any moment, so you
try to move slowly and steadily.  Carefully you make your way around a section
of the roof that is unfinished, and try to head north.

The Roof~
   You are on a part of the roof with a rope ladder hanging down from it
towards the ground.  The ground looks so far away, but you'll do anything to
escape from this nightmare.  The roof ends by the looks of it...  North of
here.  The rain is making it very slippery up here, as you can barely walk
without slipping a little.

The End of the Roof~
   You are now at the end of the roof, or what once was the roof.  The shingles
here have been washed away from the rain, making it look bare.  It's beginning
to get very slipper up here.  By the looks of it, there seems to be nowhere to
go from here.  A small chimney is directly east of you.

At the Top of the Chimney~
   This is the top of a chimney that you're at now.  The chimney seems to be
big enough for one to fit in it.  It is made of big red bricks which are also
chipped.  All over.  No smoke is coming up, so why not check out where it
leads?

The Second Floor Balcony~
   This is the second floor porch.  The rain beats down hard against the house
and the ground, as the lightning flashes and the thunder booms.  The porch is
made of wood just like everything else in this dumb old house.  There is a
small railing lining the outside of the balcony, so people don't fall off.

   This is the secret den of the owner of this house.  An old woman sits here
watching your every move.  Blood marks paint the wall along with deep
scratches.  The old woman looks to be very old, as in centuries!  You try to
smile, but she stands up and releases venom from her huge fangs!  Get out of
here and fast!!

the very wet ropes, and fly head first into the ground below you.  OUCH!!!!!

There is a small, strange vent in the corner of the room, where sounds and
strange shadows pop out of.  This is a very spooky place...
