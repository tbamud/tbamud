Seer's Tent~
   Candle light dances on the walls giving an eerie feel to this tent.
Looking around the room it is easy to tell that some sort of mystical activity
goes on here.  In the center of the room you notice a small round table upon
which a clear glass globe sits in the middle.  Strange cards are strewn over
the table, the images on them are nothing you can recognize.  A sign hangs
crookedly from the edge of the table.  The only way out is back to the south
where you entered this tent.

   The grass on each side of the path is rather tall, as the wind blows through
it you could swear you hear a whisper of some sort.  The voice is
indescribable, neither male or female and you can't make out what it is saying.
The path continues on to the north and to the east you can make out a shape of
a small tent.

North of the Circus~
   The path is very narrow and the few people that are here have trouble
passing without bumping each other.  You can hear faint animal noises that are
carried along by the wind.  The path leads to the west and south.

   Strange noises fill the air, such as you have never heard.  Directly north
there is a run down shack, boards missing and windows broken.  The door is off
its hinges and hangs precariously by what looks to be a nail.  The path
continues on to the south from here.

Old Shack~
   The shack is in a terrible mess.  There is broken furniture scattered across
the floor and broken glass everywhere.  The floor is rotted and the smell of
something that you can not place fills the air.  There is something here.....
But where?  There is a small door leading west to a dark room and to the south
you may leave back to the path.

Old Shack~
   This cramped room is quiet a mess.  A faint smell of rot and decay lingers
in the air held captive by the fact there is no window to release it.  A small
cage has been toppled over in the corner, looking as if something just made an
escape from its tiny confines.  The only way out is back to the east.

Lions, elephants and monkeys can be heard though you are not certain where the
sound comes from.  The sounds seem to echo and meld together creating a
frightful noise.

Monkey Cage~
   You have entered the monkey cage, their screeching is almost deafening.
The cage is filled with vines and branches so that they can excersize and the
monkies swing and hop from branch to branch above you.  A few sit lazily upon
the ground stuffing their faces with food the keeper brought to them.

Animal Cage~

meows can be heard.  They are so cute but the looks in their eyes tell you that
it would not be a good idea to pet them.  The only exit is to the south

Animal Cage~
   You are standing in the middle of the elephant cage.  Hay litters the floor
as well as a few piles of fruits.  The smell here is not pleasant, but you
imagine if the elephants were actually in the cage it would be worse.  A lone
baby elephant is sleeping on one of the piles of hay waiting for its mother to
return from the act in the circus.

Entrance to the Big Top~
   Before you stands an enormous tent that spans several hundred feet.  A
colorful banner has been placed over the entrance and on each side of the
banner red and white pennants flap wildly in the breeze.  Laughter and cheering
fills the air as well as the occasional roar of lions.  You can enter the big
top to the east and to the south you see an elaboratly decorated wagon.

Inside the Big Top~
   People abound here, laughing merrily and having a ball.  Clowns in funny
costumes can be seen most everywhere handing out small trinkets to the
children.  You can hear the ringmaster calling out the next act from here,
looking closer a high wire is visible to the southeast.  The bleachers are to
the south and the exit of the Big Top is to the west.

Inside the Big Top~
   Rows of seats surround you, people filling almost every one.  Children sit
on parents laps trying to catch a better view of what is going on in the three
rings where the acts take place.  Vendors walk the aisles selling various
novelties.  A few clowns have made their way up to the seating area to give the
children a thrill.  Laughter sails through the air almost as gracefully as the
man on the trapeze.  To the east you can see the main event in the center ring,
while to the north will lead you back to the entrance.

are present, you must have just missed them, or will that act be next?  Best
not linger to find out!  To the north is another ring where you can see
elephants parading around.  To the south you see a highwire with a man
tottering upon it and back to the west is the seating area.

Inside the Big Top~
   A very tall highwire dominates this ring, a young man on a bicycle rides
precariously on a thin rope as he holds a long rod in his hands for balance.
One miscalculation and his fate is sealed, hence the look of extreme
concentration on his face.  You can hear the crowd gasp for breath as he
teeters back and forth.

   You step carefully here because there are large pachyderms romping around as
if they were puppies that had yet to be house broken.  One elephant sits on a
round object, its trunk held proudly in the air.  A group of them look as if
they are playing follow the leader walking around the large circle.  While yet
another has a young beautiful girl riding gingerly on its back.  To the south
you can see the main ring and further south you can make out a highwire.

Center of the Circus~
   This large wagon is decorated with beautiful furniture and expensive looking
paintings.  A claw foot table drapped with a red silk table cloth stands in the
middle of the floor.  A black velvet high back chair rests in the corner along
side a small yet intricately carved table.  This must be the ringmasters
private quarters for only he could afford such luxury in the circus.  The door
to the north is the only exit.
