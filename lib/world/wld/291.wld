The hill near the Black Forest~
   You stand on a hill overlooking a dense forest of old oak trees. A slight
chilling breeze blows by and you can't help but shudder as you look toward it
In the middle of the forest, popping out over the trees is the tall spire of
the Citadel. The symbol of the triangled wheel on the tower's side is there
for all to see. A trail leads eastward down the hill towards the woods.

Just Outside the Black Forest~
   A chilling wind blows by you from deep within the dark forest.  You stand
near the outermost trees on a rapidly dwindling trail that winds into the dark
heart of the woods.  Your know your imagination can only scratch the surface of
the unholy terrors that lie within.  You have been warned.

The outskirts of the Black Forest~
   Little light penetrates the dense foliage of the forest.  Almost no plant
life occupies the hard, rocky ground.  If you push much further into the doomed
forest, you will be in all but total darkness.  Every so often a haunting,
diabolical laugh drifts to your ears.  It drives shivers down your spine.  You
can make out a trail to the south and east.  To the north there is a cabin.
Or you could flee the woods.

A Deserted Cabin~
   You are in a cabin in the woods.  Time has not been kind to this structure.
The logs that make up it are starting to rot, and there are a few gaps in the
walls.  Still, it does provide shelter from the wind.  The floor is a rough,
clumpy packed earth.  Whoever lived here has long since abandoned it.  But if
you take a closer look, you may find something useful.

The Black Forest~
   The trail you have followed has dwindled to a nothing.  Every so often you
think you see some movement out of the corner of the eye.  As you are looking
around, a fresh bout of evil laughter comes to your ear.  It echos off the
trees, refusing to die.  You feel a bead of sweat form on the back of your
neck.

The great oak~
   This is the largest tree in the forest.  It stretches high overhead.  The
gnarled limbs hang above you like grasping hands waiting to strangle you The
bark is rough and blood stained.  At the roots lie a fallen hero.  His body
well along in decomposition, but the cause of death is obvious.  This foolish
hero has been decapitated.

The dead end~
   You have discovered a portion of the outer wall of Ilian's Citadel.  The
nearby trees prevent you from exploring the wall.  It is an imposing mass of
cold, smooth, black granite.  So near the vile citadel, you know in your soul
this is not a place you want to be caught dead at.

The Bridge~
   This rickety covered bridge spans a rather wide natural chasm in the forest
floor.  It lit by two rusty lantern hanging off pegs in the wall.  This place
provides much protection from the icy winds common to the Black Forest.  You do
not know why, but at least here you can find some measure of sanctuary from the
evils of the woods.

   You are in a rocky ravine under the bridge.  Sparse vegitation manages to
grow in small pockets of soil interespersed about.  The loose nature of the
gravely slopes makes for difficult going.  You can surmise that this place
would fill up rapidly in a heavy rain.  You just hope that dosen't happen while
you are here.

The Dark Heart of the woods~
   In the heart of the woods, things are strangely calm.  But it is the calm
before the storm.  In the soft earth you can clearly see hoofmarks of some
horse.  Around the hoofmarks the earth is scorched as if by a hot flame.
Looking around there are the signs of a strugle.  Somebody placed his bets
against whatever made the hoofmarks, and lost.

quiet around the area.  You look at the clearing you are standing near and you
recognize it for what it is.  A killing field.  Your boot crunches on the
headless skeleton of some small woodland creature.

something truly evil.  A fresh burst of icy wind whips through the grass
sending waves rolling through the glade.  Out of the chilled wind comes a bout
of the evil, maniacle, unholy cackles that cause your hair to stand on end.

or you can flee west to the safety of the bridge.  Your other option is to
follow the river to its end.

In the shadow of the citadel~
   You turn up your collar to the subthermal gales.  That's when you see it.
From here you can see, not 200 yards ahead, the infernal structure that is the
citadel.  You whisper a silent prayer of thanks that there are still many trees
to hide behind.  It is best if the residents of the place don't know of your
existance as long as possible.  It takes a major force of effort to tear your
eyes off the citadel, but you manage.  To the west lies a small stream.  To the
north is a clearing, and south of you is a trail that leads to a small keep in
ruins.

   You have walked along the wall and now are in a small walled alcove.  The
crack of evil laughter makes you jump in fright.  It came from right behind
you!  You look around to see a headless rider on a ferocious charger that
breaths fire.  In one hand he holds the reigns to his nightmare in the other he
wields a black scimitar.  In a panic, you look around, but to your horror, you
realize you are boxed in.  The horseman rides closer, he swings his huge
scimitar, trying to lope off your head.  You manage to keep the blow from
decapitating you, but he does connect with your head, sending you sprawling.
The horseman rides off cackling.

   Once upon a time this was this keep's place of worship, but apparently the
beings that this place was consecrated to didn't chose to spare this place any
more than the rest of the castle.  Didn't chose to or weren't able to.  Maybe
when Ilian's black citadel was erected, those protecting beings withdrew their
protection to flee to safety, or maybe they made their stand with the occupants
of the castle, and shared their fate.

of debris.  The eastern half is beinh precariously held up by rotting wooden
beams.  It does not look all that stable (No pun intended), but still there is
fresh hay on the floor.  Although you take note that some of it has been
scorched by fire of some sort.  There is still water in the trough.  All this

is nothing but a memory and a heap of crumbling stones.  The great stained
glass window set into the north wall, once the pride of the castle has been
shattered into a million shards of rainbow hued glass strewn over the ground.
The east wall still seems soundly built, but you have trepidations about the
south wall It seems like it could come crashing down at any moment.

The Library~
   This chamber in the citadel is lines with rows upon rows of bookshelves.
Most are thick leatherbound tomes.  Most haven't been used in months, or years
A fine layer of dust has setteled on most of them.  The tiled floor, however is
spotless.

The Master Armorer's Workshop~
   This room is where Durlak, The citadel's armorer, does his craft.  The room
is unconfortably warm from the forge.  The walls are lined with the castle's
guardians, the DoomGuard.  Most of them are in various stages of repair, to be
worked on by Durlak.  Occasionally, one will walk into the room and stand by
the wall waiting repair.  Occasionally one of the others will become active and
begin its patrolling duties.

In the Halls of the Citadel~
   The long vaulted hall extends in an east-west direction.  It serves to
connect the Eastern complex and the Western one.  Your footsteps echo off the
walls, reverbing, rebounding, resounding, refusing to die, as if they knew that
to perish here is to risk eternal damnation.  Above you, supernatural flames
forever dance in crystal orbs that hang suspended from the ceiling by wrougt
iron chains.  The strange light these provide casts long shadows that envelop
long tracts of hall.

providing more than enough light to see by.  The statues seem to be writhing in
pain.  Each one captured in a snapshot in time, displaying its agony for all to

intricate gears, cogs, and other clockwork parts meshing and grinding above
you.  The effect is almost hypnotic.  A staircase is built into the wall
allowing access to the intricate mechanisms above, if you dare to climb it.

Hanging on a chain one moment, climing on a gear the next.  You had better act

could be disasterous.  Its a long way down, if you are lucky, if not you stand
to be a red stain between two gears.

warning the gear shudders to life and you fall.  You land between the teeth of
a moving cog and come to your senses just as it starts to move.  You barely

On the other side of the citadel you can see the observation tower extending
only slightly higher they you are now.  And then you see the spire of the
citadel which extends high into the sky, casting its long shadow across the
Black Forest.

manacles are affixed to the near wall to hold prisoners while they await
torture.  The middle of the room is taken up by several implements of pain.
There is a vat for boiling oil.  Several racks and countless hideous bladed
instruments, old, diseased, and rusty with age.

giant chamber.  In the middle of the hollowed column stands a pair of spiral
staircases twisting and turning upon each other in a doulbe helix.  There is no
central pillar on which the staircases are supported.  You have to marvel at
the wonder of engineering this is.  But only the bravest souls will climb it
because each step you take brings you that much closer to...  Her.

soon as it is produced.  Your legs plead with you to decend the steps, rather
than ascend.  For to go down is to go away from the terror at the top.

to be used.  In the background you can hear the echos of a phantasmal orquestra
playing in some forgotten and lost dimention, whose music somehow leaks through
to where you now stand.

woods.  Glancing around you see the clock tower and the observing post far
below you.  From here you can see the entire expanse of the black woods.  From
the western hills where you began this nightmare to the sea which lies FAR to
the south.  The balcony extends to the south a bit, but be careful There is no
guardrail, and that first step is a doozy.

   Well, you made it.  I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but
after all the trials and struggles, you are at the top of Ilian's citadel.  The
room seems impossibly large, and the center of it is dominated by a presence
which radiates pure, unadulterated, unmitigated, unqualified, unholy evil.  The
mistress of the citadel, Ilian sits on her throne surrounded by a small horde of
her children, She looks at you as her mastery of the dark symmetry probes your
mind to find out if you are significant enough to be bothered with.
