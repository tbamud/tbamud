In the lake~
      There is a fine layer of film that rests upon the top of the lake.
Under the lake can be seen small fish and a few pieces of garbage but nothing
important.  Also the sand at the bottom of the lake is not quite sand rather
busted up crystal making it imposable to walk on the bottom of the lake.  Also
algae floats towards the top of the lake making it hard to see up from the
bottom of the lake.

Patch of land~
   Here lies a small patch of land in the middle of the lake.  There is a small
mist that covers the outside of the lake making it unreachable.  You cannot
even see where you come from on the shore side of the lake.  It may be too late
to turn back.  Sand covers the ground here with a small patch of square shaped
grass in the center of the small island.

There is thick gray fog around everything leaving you wandering where you are

In the fog~
   Here it is hard to see anything besides what is in the area with you.
There is thick gray fog around everything leaving you wandering where you are
and where to go.  This must be some kind of magic because the fog seems to not
be moving any and it has a strange glow to it.

Before the castle~
   You find yourself standing before a massive crystal castle.  It seems to be
flawless and very delicate yet very strong in design.  There are many small
crystals poking out from the sides of the castle making it impossable to scale
the wall.  There is a large gate leading into the castle directly to the north.

Dragons Lair~
   You have entered a large room with very little decorations and no kind of
art.  There are claw marks and very large holes in the walls and ceiling
around.  The floor is very hard and seems to be composed of crystal.  The roof
is also made of the same materials.
