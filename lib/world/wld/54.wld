The Dancing Daemon Inn~
   A huge circling wet-bar takes up most of the east end of the Daemon.  An
old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis.  The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage.  The large booths along the
all are filled with people drinking and having a grand time.  You feel like
partying here.
The only obvious exit is to the north.
