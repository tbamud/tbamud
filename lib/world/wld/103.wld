buildings

tending to the gardens, others training their skills.  But one thing is certain,
all of them look male.

battered,
like it has been through many storms.  Off to the east you see a small island

large black CC.

The Ocean Shore~
   @BThe ocean flows up onto the sandy shore, dampining the soft sand on the
shore.  The smell of salt lingers in the air and the sun beats down hard on the
sand.  The waves echo through the thick forest to the east, although there is
no entrance here.  Seaguls fly overhead, adding to this beautiful scene.  Hermit
crabs have made this area their home, digging holes in the sand.  A starfish
lies amongst the sand here and there, and small birds chirp in the forest.
This place seems to be perfect to just relax and take a break from the everyday
life.  @n

The Mouth of the River~

of the river, and the serene sun shining down into the river, making it so you
can see the every little ripple in the water.  Magnificent fish add to the
beautiful scene here,@n @Bswimming through the river distorting the image of the
small pebbles on the bottom.  Leaves fall gently into the river and majesticly
float down the stream.  This area looks to have been untouched by the
destructive human hand,@n @Bthe trees to the northwest are to thick to see
through much less walk through.  This also seems to be a perfect place to relax
from the troubles of everyday.  @n

A Large Oak Tree~
   @gThis area has been cleared, nothing grows here but a comfortable lush
grass, a large oak tree is growing here, shading everyone who comes into this
area, the sun cannot get through the leaves of this tree, it seems to have been
placed here on purpose, a magical feeling is coming from the tree, it makes
your body tingle.

   @gThe ground is moist here as well, and the air still smells of apples, but
it is stronger here then it would be anywhere else.  Apple Trees grow wildly
here, and there is no other tree to be seen.  To the north is a lot of brush.

Start of the Brush~
   @gThe orchards end marks the beginning of the brush, it is thick, but there
seems to be a path leading straight through it, the sounds of people come from
the other side of the brush.

Path Through the Brush~
   @gThe brush seems to have been cleared out in this area explicitly for
walking, the brush on both sides of you looks to be dangerious.  @g It looks as
if there are multiple animals caught in the brush on both sides.

A Dangerous Path~
   @gThe large pile of brush seems to have not been placed there on purpose, it
seems as though it has grown there over the years, and it grows here as well,
but not as much, for it seems to have been trodden down by people.

Journeys End Inn~
   @gA large torn looking building cast shadows all over the place.  A sign on
the door shows you that this place has been closed for many years.  The windows
are broken, and a few are just missing.
