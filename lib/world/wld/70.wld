The Small Room~
   The only thing in this room of interest is a chair, and that appears
to have been bolted to the rock floor.  A doorway leads south and another
leads east into darkness.

A Ledge By A Dark Pool~
   You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there is quite a drop
down.  You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness,
mostly because of the trickling of water.  The water from the sewer actually
washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery.  From here it drops,
like a waterfall, into the pool far down.
