Lord's Keep Zone Description Room by Kaan~
   *Lord's Keep *Written by Kaan for Dibrova This is the ancestral home of the
Lord of Jareth, who has governed the City of Freedom since the days when Jareth
was but a vision in the first Lord's head.  Since then, a new Lord has always
ascended to the position which keeps Jareth profitable and free, in Lord's Keep.
This zone has a small quest written into it - the Lord's daughter, Penelope was
abducted by Mordecai (another zone available) and now the Lord weeps in mourning
for his beloved daughter.  Save the daughter from Mordecai and bring her back in
one piece to her father, get a large pile of gold.  There is some mid- to
upper-level eq and mobs here, as well as some fun areas to explore.  This zone
is meant to connect to Jareth.

   Ha!  Lucky, you were always lucky!  Under the pillow is a half-written
letter, unaddressed.  The bits of text that aren't smudged, burnt, and smeared
tell tale of the smith/mage Gabadiel's masterwork: a sword of unequalled power,
and two swords that came before, discarded as 'Not quite what I was working
towards'.  Looking around, you notice a distinct lack of any swords.  You think
you may have a motive now...

huge table dominates most of the room, benches running along two sides for
seating.  Another table, also fairly large but smaller than the main table, sits
high on a dias perpendicular to the long table.  This second table is most
obviously the Lord's own dining table.  An enormous, ornate fireplace commands
the eastern wall, sufficient to heat the entire room and then some.  You may
leave through the main entrance to the north or through a set of swinging doors
leading into the kitchen to the west.

The Beginning of a Very Dark & Uncomfortable Passageway~
   You have entered a very cramped earthen passageway which is darker than
darkest night.  You feel something skitter by you feet and give a small shudder
at the thought of what it might be.  The walls seem to have been man made, dug
out of hard clay, without supports.  You begin to feel a chill, and even a bit
damp, although the walls themselves are not wet or even clammy, just cold.  The
tunnel heads east into darkness or you may climb back out into the gazebo.

him.  A long mirror adorns the north wall, a small basin filled with water
stands next to it, and a dust brush sits on a shelf next to the mirror.  Lounge
chairs are resting along the south wall, although from the grooves worn in the
wood from centuries of nervous pacing, most people who enter this room don't use
the chairs very often.  Doors are to the east and west.

who are on their break, but currently there are none there.

sits closed at present.  Pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of this office,
you feel that the Lord must be a kind and just man and deserves the priviledges
his title offers.  A door to the west allows exit.

Lord's Gardens~
   This may very well be the most beautiful peace of land you ever have set foot
upon.  Vibrant colors surround you, lending you a feeling of serenity and bliss.
Knowing that such wonders can exist in nature lends you the realization that
although at many times the world appears to be flawed, there is a balance of
perfection that gives those flaws their very reason for existance.  A winding
stone path wends it's way through the garden, heading north and west, and a door
to your south allows entrance back into the keep.

   This room, austere almost to the point of being monkish, boasts only the
necessities for sleeping.  A bed, although large, sits in the center of the room
looking as if its use is as minimal as its style.  The only other furnishings in
the room are a dresser, a small wardrobe, and, curiously, a portrait delicately
painted in soft hues of the Keep, sitting high upon Lord's Hill, proudly flying
the standard for Jareth.  A closed door blocks the entrance to the south and an
archway leading into the Lord's private dining room leads west, or you may exit
the Lord's Suite to your north.

Courtyard~
   You stand in the Lord's Courtyard, a place for fun and merriment, open to all
folk, be they Lord's guest or servant.  Beautiful trees dot the yard, all in
full bloom.  A trail made from wood chips wends its way through the trees and
around benches.

Gazebo~
   You have entered into an octagonal gazebo made completely of white painted
wood.  A low bench runs around the entire inside of the gazebo, looking very
comfortable.  In the center of the gazebo is a piece of wood made in the shape
of an octagon with long planks of flooring running outward from it like long
spokes.  This looks as if it would be a good place to rest, if that is your
inclination.  You may leave back into the courtyard to the west or north.

what seems wrong now.  To your east the Grand Reception Hall continues, to your
north a stable is provided, south you see a wooden door bound in iron, and to

   The street begins to widen slightly.  Flags from many of the noble houses
begin at regular intervals along either side of the street.  The grass is still
well-kept here, but not as many people lounge on it here as there were closer to
the city.  Although not threatening in any way, the mood of this street seems to
get a bit gloomier with each step you take toward the keep.

On the Drawbridge~
   Standing in front of the keep, one cannot help but feel daunted to some
degree.  Some of the feeling is due to the sheer immensity of this castle, it's
powerful presence, but you also can't help but feel that something must be wrong
here.  The guards standing at attention here are afraid to even look in any
direction but straight ahead and from inside the castle you hear no sounds of
merriment or laughter, as is usually the case in the entryway of the Lord's
Keep.  The Lord's Court lies west of you, while the twin guard towers flank your
entry to the east into Lord's Keep.

the spiked bottom of the portcullis peeks out from its resting position, seeming
almost threatening.  The Twin towers rising out of stone foundations as big as a
house themselves seem to leer at you from their arrowholes inlaid in the walls.
You can proceed into the Keep to the east or leave the Keep to the west.

downwards.

overwhelming warmth of the air.  The musky odor has grown quite intense,
drowning out everything else in the air and making it hard to breathe.
Something in your gut begins squirming uncomfortably as you wonder what's
ahead...
