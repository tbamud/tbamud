Entry into the Darkness~
   A cold rush of air rushes up from the depths of the caverns, one that could
chill a frost giant.  The uncompromising, black granite walls reflect the
flickering light back in a thousand ways, making this place seem surreal, almost
otherwordly.  A steep slope heads east, downward into darkness.  There are no
sounds of movement or voices at all, only the steady, quiet drip of the caverns'
moist walls.

Connector Zones: The Plains of Blood
These are a sytem of caverns made of black rock which catacomb for
many miles. There are a number of cavernous mobs, all of them
relatively high level - even the bats kick some ass. This zone is
mainly intended to be a zone for high level players to gain good exp
and find some good eq.

Descending Into the Depths~
   The air gets markedly colder the farther to the east that is traveled.  The
floor slopes gently at first, then with more vigor as it continues.  Soon anyone
trying to negotiate east would have to lean back as they walk just so that they
might keep their balance.

The Air Gets Cold~
   It is no longer getting cold, it IS cold.  The air has dropped dwon near
freezing, the steady breeze that blows through the caves making it seem all the
more cold.  The floor continues to slope downward to the east, the darkness as
complete as darkness can be.  Any sounds made in this dark, lonely place echo
back a thousand fold - making the isolation complete.

Deeper and Deeper~
   The steady depth at which the cavern angles toward is enough to make ears pop
and eyes water.  A faint pinpoint of light is all that can be seen of the
entrance far west and above this locale.  Oddly, there seems to be no change in
the color or makeup of the rock walls that this tunnel runs through.  They are a
solid, gleaming black which seems to both reflect the light and soak it up all
at once - it is unnerving.

Hundreds of Feet Below the Surface~
   The surface, the open air - it is all now just a memory.  It is easy to lose
track of time down in places such as these with no light and no other human
contact.  The steady drip of the walls is still all that comes back from this
dreary place as you make your way through.

The Floor Levels~
   The tunnel bends to the south, heading level and straight in that direction.
To the west the cavern begins its steep ascent toward the exit and open air.
Somewhere - perhaps far away, perhaps close nearby - the sound of steady
breathing can be heard, or at least that is what it sounds like.

A Smooth Passage~
   The walls of the cave are still made of the same rock as the rest of the
caverns, however here the walls and floor are unnaturally smooth, almost like
black marble.  The sound of the breathing comes a bit louder now, a steady
rasping breath that almost sounds like a heavy smoker asleep.

A Secret Chamber~
   This is no more than a small area in the smooth walls, which was somehow
hidden on the outside by the rock's smooth, reflective surface.  The sound of
the breathing is no doubt coming from a small opening just to the west, a place
that gives a certain aura of dread.

Chamber of Fear~
   This chamber is aptly named, aptly indeed.  The creature which occupies this
small space is a feyr, pronounced *fear*, a creature made and created by the
terrible fears of men and beast in the area.  A feyr is said to rest during
daylight hours in places such as this and terrorize the ones who unknowingly
created it during the night hours.  It is said only very powerful magic can
destroy or even harm a creature such as this one.

   The walls are not as smooth here as they are to the north, however they are
still quite smooth to the touch.  Certainly there are no sharp points to these
walls.  Somewhere - perhaps far away, perhaps close nearby - the sound of steady
breathing can be heard, or at least that is what it sounds like.

Near an Alcove~
   To the east the cave widens, opening into what appears to be a very large,
open area.  The feel of the breeze which runs through the caves seems to come
from that direction.  To the west, the cave makes a curve to the north, heading
into darkness.  These two directions are interesting enough by themselves, but
the real interest at this juncture is the alcove just north and what lies
within.

An Alcove~
   Some old straw has been strewn about the floor, heaps of stinking waste and
droppings lie scattered in the hay.  It appears that the creature which occupies
this space feels no need to stay clean and tidy.  It also appears that the
creature eats well from the number of skeletons and loose bones scattered
through the hay and wastes.

   The cave widens, opening east into an enormous subterranean cavern.  The
sound of running water comes from somewhere in that cavern, however exactly
where is hard to tell, since everything here echoes.  To the west is a passage
quite the same as the one you now stand within.

   This is a huge cavern, the ceiling lost in darkness at the highest point,
sloping high and away from the walls.  The southeast wall glimmers and shimmers,
this being the source of the running water, as the entire wall is covered in a
cascade of clear water which runs down through a crack in the ceiling.

   The cavern's southern wall is a mass of moldy growth, the fungus growing wild
along the wall.  Just east on the wall is a cascade of water, running from an
unknown source out of a crack in the ceiling and disappearing into another crack
in the floor.  The cavern itself looms ever large, the black walls glistening in
the faint light.

   The water cascades over the south wall, making it look almost as if it had a
pane of glass over the rock in constant movement.  The water looks to be clear
and clean, its fresh scent a nice change from the dreary stuffiness of the
caverns.  To the east there is an opening in the ceiling above the cascade, it
looks like you might fit up there.

room, but a sound can be heard - almost like someone clicking their nails loud
enough for it to echo.

and walls are covered in grease and grime and the Gods only know what else.

the clan should go out and slay as many of the neighboring gibberlings as
possible, as the shaman is quite fond of gibebrling meat.

discipline in the ranks that needs doled out, it is this bugbear who does the
doling.  Being that he also leads most raids, the leader is often replaced out
of need - bugbears are not stupid, but neither are they all that smart.

Den of the Bugbears~
   This is the private den of the bugbear chief.  All matters pertaining to the
clan end at this one.  If the leader or shaman wish to impose their will upon
the clan, they first must get the support of the chief.  If the chief disagrees,
then it ends there.  A chief can only be replaced through a direct challenge
from another of the clansmen, therefore the chief always remains a young, robust
bugbear with great physical prowess.

A Steep Climb~
   This has turned out to be some sort of shaft or chimney which leads far up
into the rock above.  The water does not flow from this place, it is completely
dry here and hand holds abound, making the climb relatively easy.

Up Toward a Fresh Scent~
   The breeze wafting down from above carries the same fresh smell of the water
below.  Could the source of the cascade be somewhere above?  The scent energizes
you, giving you fresh vigor for the climb.

Small Cavernway~
   This is the top of the chimney, the dark shaft leading back down into the
main cavern below.  This cavernway leads off to the east and west, following
along the shore of an underground lake which looks to be quite deep indeed.
The lake is close enough that you could stick your toe in it - the ledge you
stand upon must drop off quite immediately into the water.  To the west, the
ledge curves around the 'shore' of the lake, plus a small cave leads away from
the lake's edge even farther west.

Along the Tributary~

this walkway.  It appears that the water flows east into the lake, which must
then leak somewhere underneath down along the wall of the cavern below,
cascading past the cavern down deeper into the earth.

   The source of the water may never be known, at least not at this point as the
water comes from some place past this wall which keeps any further travel east
impossible.  There is a narrow passage to the north, a barely noticeable thing
leading away from the tributary's shore.

   A strange quiet pervades this small area.  One that is completely unsettling

a holy man of some sort.

point where they meet the far eastern wall on the other side of the hole.

of litter, indeed they are free of dirt, as it appears they are swept or
scrubbed regularly.  The passageway continues east for a short distance further
then turns north, the vaulted ceiling turning with the rest of the cavern.

both of short, bald men who hold their hands over their hearts and stare
resolutely into space in front of them.  To the east the cavern continues,
however the walls and ceiling become rough, no longer carved in that direction.
The way east gains width as it runs in that direction, getting more and more
wide with every foot east.
