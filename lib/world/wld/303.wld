Dorm Room~
   This dorm room seems to be unoccupied at the moment.  The same furniture is
in this room as any other dorm room, a desk, bed, and exit...  This time to the

The Animal Cage~
   This room certainly does not resemble a regular dorm room, as it has been
completely renovated and then altered and then renovated again.  It now
contains bars hanging from the ceiling and where the desk should be, according
to the layout of every other room you have seen here at least, stands a large
water bottle structure similar to the ones used in modern day hamster and
gerbil cages.  The only exit is to the west.  Just as you finish looking
around, your eye spots a SEP.

   This is Someone Else's Problem.  The only way that you are able to spot it is
by jumping around and looking like an idiot as you try and avert your eyes so
that it can be seen.  Unfortunately, seeing it doesn't help.  It looks like some
sort of Italian Bistro...  Rather strange actually.

   This hallway grinds to a halt here.  The main reason it halts is because

Smithville~
   This room is a replica of Smithville.  In a really, really small form that
is.  You didn't think we could get the entire town in one room do you?  Think
about it...  You'd try to buy something from one shopkeeper and the other four
would say that they don't have that item.  The logistics just don't work on
these magnitudes, with more rooms maybe, but definitely not one room.  There is
an exit to the north.

is roaming the apartment...  Have you seen it yet?  There is opulent furniture
furnishing the room, such as a rocking chair, a coffee table, and a couch.
All of the furnishings are decorated in a somewhat flowery style.  You can
leave this room by going east to the entrance hall or south to the bedroom.

   From this balcony you can see a marvellous countryside.  Cows, horses, cats,
