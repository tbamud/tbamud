The City of Haven~
   Haven is located far south of the capital.  The city thrives because it's the
main supplier of fish and other sea goods to the capital.  The location of the
city provides quite a scenery.  There are mountains to the east and forest to
the west.  More of a jungle really.  The sea is just south of the city with a
beautiful sandy beach, stopped abruptly by the mountains to the east and a range
of impassable cliffs not far west of the forest line.  The South Road (people in
Haven have always laughed at this name for it, since from here it actually goes
north) begins just outside a marvelous city gate.  The gate is more for show
though than for protection since Haven never had anything to fear because of its
remote location.  Anyway, what lord would be inerested in a few fish?  This has
not really changed, even with the coming of the south road, since regular
patrols of elite soldiers are assigned to protect it and garrison the city
itself.

The Captain's Cabin~
   The cabin looks comfortable, but not exactly opulent or rich.  The round
windows are open to let in the salty breeze.  A couch is under one of these,
made of horsehair and very soft-looking.  Maps of the sea line the walls, along
with the many instruments used in sailing.  There is also a bed and a small
stove here, next to the writing desk.  All of the furniture is securely bolted
to the floor, thus unaffected by the ship's rocking.  The door to the north
leads back out onto the decks.

Harem Room~
   Interesting.  The Lord of Haven is quite obviously a man with a vice.
Scantily clad women fill this room.  There are piles of silks and pillows all
over the floor, looking comfortable to just rest in.  There is a particularly
large pile of the softest pillows against the west wall.  Maybe they are for
Degruziel's favorite girl.

Degruziel's Private Chamber~
   This room is floored in lush red carpet, soft and almost ankle deep.  The
curtains are open over the windows, giving you a wonderful view of the garden.
The walls here are white, where they aren't obscured by tapestries of the local
gods and goddesses.  Against the wall by the only exit, the door you came in
through, there is a great oak wardrobe.  With much space inside.  What catches
and hold your attention, however, is the huge bed in the center of the room.
It could comfortably sleep three, but looks more to the liking of two.  It
looks comfortable.

Top of the Staircase~
   The room at the top of the staircase isn't so large, nor so fancy, as the
rooms of the lower story.  These rooms on the second floor must be private
rooms, not meant for the public eyes.  Though not as brightly lit as the area
downstairs, you can still see well by the torches lining the stone walls.
There is a curtained window looking outside, while there are also doorways
leading north and east.  A simple staircase against the west wall leads up into
the tower of Degruziel's Manor, the door up there being barred with a very
LARGE lock.  There is a curtained window looking outside, to the south and the
sea.  To the north is a plain, low door.

Servant's Quarters~
   The room is crowded, but a faint breeze scented with smells of the garden
wafts in through an open window.  It must be getting funneled in around the
tower, because the window is facing north, and the wind usually blows from the
south.  There are several mats lying out on the middle of the floor, and a
drawn-back curtain separates the room into sections.  The mats, though only
filled with straw, look pretty comfortable.

   You step into the dark wetness of the prison chamber...  And the heavy iron

The Double Stairway~
   Against the north and south walls are twin pairs of beautiful staircases.
They are salmon-colored marble arms curving into an embrace of the center of
the room, where a fountain stands.  The exquisite marble fountain is of a fish
perched on its tail, water spurting from its mouth.  Back to the east the red
carpet begins again, while the stairs lead up to the second floor of the Manor.

An Artfull Hallway~
   This room is only called a hallway because it connects one room in the Manor
to another, not because of its size.  Beautifully stitched tapestries line the
walls, each with its own story to tell.  Carvings, sculptures, paintings, and
all sorts of forms of art are scattered around, some hanging and others on
marble stands that are themselves sculptures.  Here the stone floor has been
covered in rich red carpet.  To the north is a small plain door, and to the
west is a twin set of double, majestically curving staircases.

Degruziel's Audience Chamber~
   Through the door lies a small office, where Degruziel likes to hold his
appointments, inner councils, audiences, and other such functions.  There is a
round table in the center of the room, set with six chairs, and a desk in the
nearest corner.  The desk is piled with all sorts of papers, scrolls, and
writing utensils.  The candleholders on both the table and the desk are fancy,
like everything else in the room, but they also have an air of utility about
them instead of the plain oppulance of the hallway you just exited.  The stone
walls are lined in shelves which are covered in books.  Behind the high-backed
wooden chair is a small painting, and on the north wall is a window facing into
the garden.

Degruziel's Parlor~
   This must be where Degruziel, the Lord of Haven, entertains his guests.
There are comfortable chairs and couches strewn about the center of the large
room.  Above the massive fireplace there sets a large painting of the god of
the sea.  Before the fireplace there is a long mahogony dining table, large
enough to seat twelve.  Tapestries cover the stone walls.  From the archway to
the east drift pleasant smells, while to the west, across a distance filled
with art, you can see a double curving stairway.

The Manor Porch~
   The cart path here leads both eastward toward the stables, where a body
might visit the horses, or to the north through the garden and back to the
street.  To the south is the Lord of Haven's oppulant porch and front door.
The railing of the porch is carved to resemble a vine twisting about itself,
while the posts are exquisitely carved into fish sitting on their tails, with
their mouths around the railing.  Their jeweled eyes wink in the light.  The
door is a large, fanciful myriad of carvings depicting a local legend.

The railings are all one piece of wood, a flowing flowery vine.  The flowers
collect water and form pools for small bird baths.  The posts holding the
railing up are of the same piece of wood as the railing itself, and are of
Haven's main export, fish, standing on their tails and supporting the vine with
their mouths.  The sapphires that form the eyes of the fish twinkle merrily,
almost making you believe the fish to be alive.

   Serving girls bustle about all around this pleasant-smelling room.  It is
very warm in here, from all the heat being given off by the many stoves, ovens,

are the bustling serving girls.  A cooling rack for bread is fastened against
one wall, while a cellar entrance is not to far away from the archway leading

   The interior of the stables is dim, but you can make out many rows of rather
spacious, grand stables.  A little bit much for horses and such, but if that is
the way a person wants to spend their money...  The smells of hay and horses
are strong, and the soft sounds of stable boys calming some of the more skitish
horses that were startled by your entry can be heard in the far back of the
complex over the swish of tails and the periodic whinny.

   The winding cart path that passes from the street by the Lord's front porch
and onward to the stables also passes through his magnificent flower garden.
The gentle hues of purples, reds, whites, yellows, and blues rest the eyes from
all the other attractions in the city.  The purfume of the everblooming flowers
fill the air pleasantly, mingling with the salty breeze of the sea.  Vines hang
festively from the branches of the many trees, and animals cavort under them,
unafraid.  The cart path continues both toward the street and toward the porch,
up to you to choose the way.

   This room, beyond any of the others, is cluttered with many stolen goods.
Everything from rolls of carpet to chests of coins and jewels are here,
carefully packed to be sold on the black market.  Some of the towers are so
high that if you are not careful and wary of your step they might collapse,
crushing you.  This is obviously where the current inhabitants of the Hideout
store the majority of their booty.

   The floor of this room is littered in rolls of bedding, its single candle
not helping to illuminate much of anything in the dim room.  The sounds of
people in slumber filter through, as if the room is very much occupied.  This
room is way to dim to see the edges of, but it echos as though the chamber is
very large.  Water drips somewhere to the east, pinging in the bottom of an

dark, the black lump of wax on the table indicating the candle that had once
lit this room burned down long ago.  This room might have once been splendid,
but now its bright tapestries are faded and covered in dust, the red carpet
rotten and ready to fall apart.  Even the full-sized portrait on the east wall
is faded beyond recognition.

   This is the most brilliantly lit room you have seen in the whole of the
thieve's hideout, with several small, low-burning candels set up under a
picture of a beautiful woman.  The colors of the candles vary from bright red,
to dried-blood, to the deepest midnight black.  You feel as though it wouldn't
be prudent to speak above a whisper in this room.  The air here is serious and
mournful, with the boards of the floor and both the stone walls and ceiling
painted black.  The small current of flowing air ripples the black fabric
covering the arch to the north.

   When a person thinks of Haven with its Crowded Market and its patrols of
elite guards one doesn't often think of a thieve's headquarters.  But the is
what you find yourself in - a skillfully hidden and very dry thieve's hideout.
Tapestries line the walls, most likely as stolen as the comfortable furniture
scattered around on the wooden floor.  The light is dim - a single candle
leaves many conspicuous shadows around the room.  There is a glow through the
archway to the east, also.

water, littered on the bottom by old stones.  The water stretches out far past

muck, consisting of water, sand, rotten seaweed, and some other things you

It churns violently in some places, as if there are living things under it.

deep stagnant water.  The docks here descend to the street to the north,
forcing you to crouch, while to the south there is a hole in the rocks that
might be the lair of a king crab.  A rope ladder hands down from the docks
aboe, green with moss that thrives in the moist air.  It would be a tight
squeeze, but you also think you might be able to edge between the wood and the
rocks to the north, but your ability to return is indeed questionable.

muscular arms pitching fish over the railing quickly, their movements almost a
blur.  Skinnier men dart here and there, what they are doing quite unapparent
to you.  There is a trap door leading to below the decks not far from where you
stand, while to the south is the door of a cabin.

The sand is soft and the beach smooth from the constant wind.  The water here
is warm and calm, lapping in gentle waves.  Children of the town swim merrily,
all the way out to the jagged rocks that waves crash against the other side of,
throwing spray into the air.  It is a good thing those rocks are there to act
as breakers, or this beautiful beach wouldn't be swimable.

before it will become one of Aramut's fine crafts.  The south 'wall' of the
workroom is open, with several feet of a drop to the deep water and jagged
rocks below.  It would be wise not to step to close - the wind past the
entrance is swift, though the inside of the workroom is strangely calm.  There

It definitely isn't the small, one-man boat the words 'fishing boat' would
likely bring to mind.  It is monstrous!  Sailors with carst stand waiting as
huge fish are constantly pitched over the side of the ship.  Other men stand in
line, waiting for the front cart to be filled and rush off to the market so
that they may move up and have their own filled.  A plank ramp leads up onto
the deck.

On the Docks~
   The docks of Haven are rumored to be a marvelous place - or so the
conversations you have overheard between townspeople and weary travelers say.
But from here you can't see much of them.  There is just plain too much
traffic.  On both sides of the docks here there are wet-looking sand closest to
the shore, while further out waves crash into treacherous rocks.  There is a
slippery rope ladder over the side here, hanging down into the darkness under
docks.

rushing both to the market and to the docks, the wideness of the road makes it
somehow less crowded.  There is loud, bawdy singing to the east somewhere, and
a sandy beach to the south, strangely flat.

cobbles by the quick passage of feet.  To the south there is a large ramp
leading onto the docks.  Sailors pushing carts at furious paces speed along,
and it's surprising that they don't crash into each other.  Far out along the
docks you can see men rushing on and off of giant fishing vessels, and even a
few colorful ships.  To the north is a squat building, in good repair.  The
open door spills the smells of beer and heavier drinks out onto the street,
along with the bawdy drinking songs the patrons are singing.  Above the door is
nailed a cracked mug.

Sandy Path~
   This path has barely any traffic compared to the rest of Haven.  The few
people here are leisurely loitering, enjoying the scenery.  From somewhere to
the east tendrils of bawdy songs reach your ears, quickly swept away by the
rush of the ever-present sea breeze.  Looking to the east you can see the rush
of men on to and off of the dock entrance that is there, while to the west the
area is peaceful.

Inside the Cracked Mug~
   This is quite obviously a fisherman's bar, from the net hanging across the
ceiling, which is currently being used to hand lanterns from, to the giant
trophy fish hung on the walls.  Both the smells of beer and pipesmoke hand
heavily in the air in the hazy room, and the tables are spread near together on
the dirty floor.  To the north a short, muscular, young bar keeper is polishing
glasses with a dirty rag when he isn't serving drinks.

The cobbles here are clean, and the smell of salt is strong.  To the north the

if they expect something monstrous to leap out of the alley at any second.
From there the pungent odors of trash and other unpleasant smells drift towards
you.  Cackling, insane laughter and assorted gibberish can also be heard from
the darkness created by the overhanging roofs.  It really isn't a wonder people
hurry past with their noses covered by handkerchiefs.

Corner of North Gull Road and Riverwalk~
   Here, North Gull Road intersects with Riverwalk.  North Gull road goes east
through the residential section while Riverwalk goes south, close to the bank
of the swiftly running stream.  The once rushing, giant river that had carved
the vale that Haven now lies in is now nothing more than quick stream.  On the
other side of the stream begins a dense forest, the leafy foliage and dense
undergrowth so thick that you can see nothing else.

small trees in some of the small yards, and periodic small beds of flowers add
their scents to the breeze that sweeps across the clean cobbles.  Strolling
residents occasionally pass you, smiling happily.  To the west is the
intersection with Riverwalk, which hardly has any more people than South Gull
Road has.  There are white benches that you might rest on, however.

tied, in the case of the sailors and fishermen getting struck at sea by a
storm.

Mithroq's Instruments of Destruction~
   This shop is full of weapons of all kinds.  Indeed it wouldn't be wise to go
too close to the walls, for the sheer number of naked sharp things hanging from
the wooden racks there would shred you if any of the delicate structures
collapsed.  It might be a nice idea to ask the shop keeper why he doesn't get
sturdier-looking racks...  But then again, maybe he has them flimsy for a
reason.  There is no way a thief would be able to grab any of those without the
utmost caution.  The open door to the west leads back to Market Path, while
Mithroq the minotaur stands behind a counter to the east, sharpening a giant
sword and looking ready to help you.

however, with a large wooden counter seperating you and the huge pile of gold
that takes up much of the other half of the room.  A guard stands behihd the
counter, prepared for trouble with his hand resting lightly on the hilt of his
sword.  There is also a short, thin gentleman here in rich silk clothes, quite
obviously Milos the Banker of Haven.  The door to the south leads back to South

the screams of assorted seabirds.  The salty breeze blows a fine, refreshing
mist onto you face.

house's stands open, the resident of the house is not there.  Perhaps they left
in a hurry to the beach to retrieve a child, or maybe they went to the market
for some last minute supplies.  The wind whistles through the cracks on the
boulders and would set all but a deaf person's teeth on edge.

of Haven, the market.  The traffic here, though more than you can see the the
north, only gets worse as you go further south towards the colorful canopies.
Shops line the east, but it appears most of the owners are out to the market.
One shop is still open, one with a hanging sign nailed above the door,
portraying a smoking vial.

docks in the safely deep water.  You can tell they are merchant vessels, for no
fisherman with carts or anything else dash up and down their planks like they
do for the ships further down.  The merchant vessels have sails of many colors,
with flags from assorted kingdoms.  To the north the street is a bit far off,
while to the south there are some of Haven's famous fishing vessels.

constantly sweeping it.  The water here is warm and calm, lapping in gentle
waves.  Children in their underwear, probably children of the town, swim
merrily, all the way out to the jagged rocks that waves crash against the other
side of, throwing spray into the air.  It is a good thing those rocks are there
to act as breakers, or this beautiful beach wouldn't be swimable.

watch you from the shadows, hostile and almost as large as small cats.  It is

inhabitants of this alley shy away from the small amount of light streaming in
from the south and the intersection, their eyes accustomed to darkness and hurt
by the natural light.

throws you down into the bone-chilling water with a SPLASH!!  As you surface,
before you have even the slightest time to react, you are dashed against the
jagged rocks by the pounding waves.

Children of the town swim merrily, all the way out to the jagged rocks.  Waves
crash hard against the other side of those rocks, throwing spray into the air.

are hauling empty carts, smiling as their full purses jangle from their hips.
To the north you can glimpse colorful canopies and crowds of people, while to
the south you can hear the crash of waves breaking on rocks.  If you squint
perhaps you can see a bit of the shimmering blue of reflected light where the
winding road breaks between the many houses and establishments.

claustrophobic, it would be wise to keep your hands near your belt pouch.

The Fisherman's Shack~
   This shack is quite small, but looks very comfortable.  Against the east
wall three bunks are stacked on top of each other in such a way as to fit, but
to give each person enough space to lay down comfortably.  There is a small
stove against the north wall, its red coals lighting the room.  A new hangs
across the single window facing to the south and Sandy Path, serving as a
curtain.  There is a bin of fish, Haven's main staple, against the west wall.
The small floor, what isn't covered by a rug, is neatly swept dirt.

The Manor Torture Chamber~
   This isn't exactly the cellar that the doors implied it would be.  It looks
as though Lord Degruziel isn't exactly popular with everybody.  The room is
dimly lit by a glowing brazier filled with red hot coals.  There is also a hot
iron rod in the brazier, and it doesn't look too friendly.  You can barely make
out a rack of glinting torture implements on the far wall, right to the left of
the iron maiden.  Some of those instruments would make even the most
hard-hearted and evil of the realm balk.  There is a heavy iron door to the
west, with a small slit for looking inside to check on the prisoners.

Luna's Square~
   You step into the light created by many burning bundles of oil-soaked cloth,
obviously makeshift torches, which light this open square.  Piles of filthy
rags are heaped against the walls, serving as beds for those without homes.
There is an old wooden chair against the east 'wall' of the square.  Once it
might have been magnificent, the square, but now the once-beautiful fountain is
just a granite-incased stagnant puddle, and the square itself is horribly dirty
and in disrepair.

Luna's Alley~
   The narrow alley is twisting, dark, and full of rotting trash.  The niches
in the walls hold eyes the glow the reflection of your own light back at you,
and laughter echos in the close space along with gibberish and screams seeming
to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.  Rats scurry around your feet and
watch you from the shadows, hostile and almost as large as small cats.  It is
not much of a wonder that the people of Haven avoid this place, using it only
as a dump.  Light streams in from the east, almost allowing you to see the
path.

Intersection of South Gull Road and Luna's Alley~
   Animal-like howls from both the north and south block out the sounds of the
wind here, originating from a narrow, filthy alley.  The overhanging roofs make
it as black as pitch and the odd flashes you see comming from the dark of the
alley might be reflections of light in animal...  or human...  eyes.  It isn't
a wonder people hurry past this intersection with worried glances to the north
and south.

South Gull Road~
   The houses along South Gull Road are smaller than the ones you can see to
the north, but they are still quite nice.  This road is patchily shaded by the
small trees in some of the small yards, and periodic small beds of flowers add
their scents to the breeze that sweeps across the clean cobbles.  Strolling
residents occasionally pass you, smiling happily.  Perhaps they don't hear the
soft maniacal laughter that comes from somewhere to the east.

golden light onto the street.  Through the tiny, barred window you can catchi
glimpses of well-armed guards and a sparkling pile of what appears to be gold
coins.

South Gull Road~
   Quite contrary to the crowded market to the east, this street is somehow
peaceful.  This may just be because of the patrols of brawny guards that pass
by at regular intervals.  The smell of fish that is so prrevalent elsewhere in
Haven is almost absent from the air here, being replaced by the salty tang of
the sea breeze to the south which is carrying the sweet perfume of flowers your
way.  To the south the white tallness of the tower protruding from the manor
that lies there is like a bone finger raised in realization of the answer to a
pressing question.

Crowded Fish Market~
   People press in from all sides!  Under the brilliant, patched, colored cloth
there is no such thing as a sky.  There are only people wandering the crowded
market, men loading wagons, and merchants.  Oh the merchants!  Dressed in
outrageous costumes and with all sorts of accents merchants yell of their
wares, vying for your attention.  In a crowd such as this, one to make even you
claustrophobic, it would be wise to keep your hands near your belt pouch.  To
the west you spot a small, uncrowded opening leading to blue sky.

Market Road, past the market~
   People shove past, in a hurry to get wherever it is they are going.  You can
hear the swearing of various men on carts and wagons, trying to get them and
their goods through the throng.  Nearby to the east colorful stitched canopies
billow in the stiff, salty sea breeze.  The sounds of merchants yelling their
wares and people yelling to each other in general are almost overwhelming.  To
the south the throng thins into a crowd, and to the north you see the same sort
of encounter you see here.

Market Road~
   To the south the smell of fish, the press of people, and the noise of a busy
market all become greater.  On both sides of the road you can see the crowd of
people moving in all directions.  You can also glimpse the great gate of Haven
to the north, and flashes of colorful canopies to the south.  One might wonder
why so many people would be attracted to a fish market, of all things.

traffic people~
   People, mules, horses, and all manner of things race along the road here, in

carry empty baskets, the cartsmen with their full loads yelling loudly at their
straining animals.  The ones heading north lug heavy baskets full of the day's
find at the market, their expressions pleased that they got the best of the
pesky merchants.  Didn't they?

Market Road~
   The breeze from the south blows a fishy scent your way, and through the
press of people on this relatively narrow winding road you can glimpse the gate
of Haven to the north, and flashes of colorful canopies somewhere to the south.
Over the clacking of hooves on cobbles and catcalls from neighbors to each
other you can hear the dull, background roar of sea surf crashing onto rocks.
The air is hot and humid enough to make the slight breeze refreshing.

The Ornate City Gates~
   To the north lies a magnificent pair of gates.  Twenty feet high at the
least, and wide enough to drive two wagons through, side by side.  It is
entirely made of polished oak, which looks a rich golden brown and smooth to
the touch.  There are many carvings of sea animals and birds on the gate,
masterfully done, but the most eye-catching set of carvings are the twin
leaping fish.  Five feet tall themselves, their jeweled eyes winking, they are
in the direct center of each gate.  You can tell by the reverant glances of
those passing by that the people of the town are very proud of their gate.
