of creatures roaming about, but you can't tell where the sound emanates
from exactly.

but you are positive you here noises behind the door to the south, and
coming from the east.  The walls are a bit slimy and moldy here... yeech,
couldn't they hire someone to clean this place?  What will the newbies
think?  Oh well, you can continue along the hallway to the east or west.
