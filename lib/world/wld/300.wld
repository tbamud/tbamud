A Wild Valley~
   You move slowly through the green vines and thick undergrowth that
cover the valley floor.  It would appear that not many have come here
in ages.  To the west, the land rises to leave the valley.  To the
east the vegetation clears to give way to a strange uprising of stone.

1)  Edit room #00 to connect with somewhere in a jungle in your mud.
    Exits can be joined to this room from any direction but from the
    east.  Edit the room description to reflect the new exit.
*
Note:  Mercutio has provided room #57 as an easy connection point,
       connecting from room #00 to room 6121 in the Haon-Dor forest.
*
2)  Check the following items to make sure the value used for spells
    conforms to the same spell on your mud.
    *#03 -- Strength(39), Strength(39), Poison(33)
    *#04 -- Sense Life(44), Detect Poison (21)
    *#08 -- Energy Drain(25)
    *#22 -- Detect Invisible(19), Poison(33)
*
If your mud does not allow some of these as 'wand' or 'potion' type
items, replace with a suitable spell of your own choice.
*
3)  Add specials, if desired, for the mobs listed in the 'notes' section.
*
4)  Fix the files to conform to your database style, if needed.
*
Here are some recommended specials for the mobs:
  Spellcasters: #02, #03, #06, #15

Before The Dragon~
   You stand before the Dragon Ancalador.  You can still make out
its petrified form despite the earth that has filled in the crevices
between its limbs and the huge oaks, dwarfed by the dragon itself,
which have grown there.  A vague evil emanates from the once-alive
stone that terrorized nations long ago.

The Guildhall~
   This is the largest chamber cut from Ancalador's pancreas.  A long
feasting table made of coffins lashed together fills the length of the
room.  On the wall, in the dried ichor that passes for blood in
demons, is written, 'A debt we must all pay.'  A set of double
coffin-lid doors is to the west, and other exits are to the north and
up.

The Altar Of Annihilation~
   You stand before the horrific Altar of Annihilation where the magic
and power of extinguishment and dissolution are full explored.  You
feel the countless ceremonies of extinction performed here, like a
gloom that pervades the altar, which looks like a huge rib cage
centered with a demon's skull.  Before the altar is a black iron
grating covering a dark pit where the ebb of life is glorified in
sacrifice.

The Darken Pit~
   The very evil of this place seeks to extinguish your light as if
the gloom had a nefarious soul of its own.  You know true fear as
something moves in the darkness... toward you.

A Stone Tunnel~
   The dragon's throat continues east and west on a path which neither
rises nor falls.  On the south wall, to the dragon's left, a warmth
can be felt, followed by a feeling of pure evil.

Muddy Riverbank~
   You are on the south bank of a rushing river.  An old, mossy and
huge stone slab hangs over the riverbank, allowing you to cross
towards a great forest.  A verdant valley stretches before you to the
east, while the terrain to the west and south quickly become
mountainous, and impassible.
