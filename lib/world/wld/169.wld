Gibberling Caves - Tanto~
   This zone starts out with a trail leading eastward from the south road and
gradually heading up a hilly trail to a mountain, wherein lies a large tribe of
bloodthirsty gibberlings. The area starts out in room 16999 (where it connects
to the south road) and continues eastward to a mountain cave where you finally
battle the gibberling chieftain and shaman.

A Mountain Trail~
   Thick vegetation to the north and south restricts your passage to moving
east or west along the trail.  You can see the footprints of small animals and
something else, here in the dirt.  This trail must be used more often than you
suspected at first glance.

A Mountain Trail~
   The small hiking trail continues east and west from here, twisting through
the trees.  Brisk mountain breezes are blowing in from the east, from where you
can just barely make out a few peaks through the treetops.  The ground to the
south begins a steep drop away from the hills you are walking across, forming a
valley, however the trees to the north and south are too thick for travel
anyway.

A Small Clearing~
   You are in a small dirt clearing along the trail, which you can see
continues to the east and west.  The sounds of rustling leaves, and small
animals in the brush scurrying about reminds you that dangerous creatures could
be lurking nearby in the shadows, waiting for you to rest until they strike.

A Mountain Trail Ends~
   The trail leading back west to the South Road comes to an abrupt end here,
and the brush is too dense to head north or south.  The only way to continue
farther into the trees, is to climb a steep BANK covered in vines and tree
roots, up into the hilly regions to the east.

roots from the trees growing atop the hill.  It looks like you can easily get a
foothold, and climb the roots up the bank without too much trouble or injury.

A Rocky Hill~
   The western face of the hill makes a steep drop of about 20 feet to the
moist soil below, but a tangled mass of vines and roots mingled with the hard
soil makes a naturul ladder of sorts, so you would have no trouble climbing
down.  A small path to the south seems to have been intentionally cleared for
travel through the unlevel terrain.

A Craggy Slope~
   The edge of this rocky outcrop is littered with small, unstable pebbles,
which look like they could have taken many an adventurer off the side of the
cliff with them, over time.  Howling winds occasionally sweep down from the
eastern mountains, further weathering the stones of the slope, and blowing a
few more pebbles over the edge.

A Craggy Slope~
   The terrain on this narrow cliff is especially treacherous, due to the
slanted angle of the ground, combined with powerful, sweeping, winds from the
east.  To the north is a solid wall of rock, reaching at least 30 feet above
your head, while to your south is the edge of the cliff, and from your vantage
point, it's apparent that you probably wouldn't survive a fall from this
height.  The face of the rock appears to have enough deep, natural grooves to
use as footholds, if you were to decide to climb it.

boulders, which provides a momentary rest from the harsh eastern winds.
However because of the amount of rocks blocking your path here, you can only
travel north, or down, to a narrow cliff.

down to the west, in the direction of the South Road, leading to the capitol.

from a large cave which lies to the east, in the side of the mountain.  As

continue onward, rather than stay here.

   Icy blasts of air howl past, threatening to rip you from the slippery solid
rock ground beneath your feet, while small rocks and pebbles litter the
surface, making the cliff even more dangerous.  Through the deafening sound of

hauntingly fades in and out of existence...  Or was it just the wind?

you hear a sound like many animals chattering and shrieking through the echoes.

the bones.

A Dark Cave~
   The solid, stone walls glisten with a continuous leak of water droplets,
from the jagged ceiling above, from which many stalagmites hang, deliberately
chopped and broken to make travel easier.  Many small footprints blanket the
dirt floor, accompanied by a powerful, musky aroma of wild beasts, or so it
would appear.

A Dark Cave~
   This room is thick with the dog-like smell of gibberlings, going about their
daily routine, making weapons and eating, which are two of their favorite
hobbies.  In this narrow section of the cave, it's a marvel to watch so many of
these crazed, ill-mannered beasts exist in such a small area.  There is barely
even room to manuever here, so they simply rush through, trampling anything in
their path.

   The ground is anything but level here, as you struggle to navigate through
the gibberlings emerging from all directions, across the especially jagged
surface of the ground, which is pock marked by pits and large stones strewn
across the area.  The room looks like it's been through at least one cave in,
or a collapse, perhaps the gibberlings just dug their way through after being
trapped in the cave by enemies long ago.

A Stony Corridor~

on makeshift shelves dug into the walls, affirming this as a room of daily
importance.

iron and steel makeshift instruments.

parts, cold, sharp instruments lining the stone walls, while horrible sounds of
anguish, escape the lips of dying and dismembered animals and unlucky
travellers.

reaching deep into the bowels of the cave.  Pebbles kicked off the bridge,
never seem to reach the bottom.  It's a wonder this bridge still stands,
judging by the amount of gibberling traffic that must cross it's meager length
daily.  A smell of decaying flesh wafting out of the chasm, affirms the death
of many a gibberling who died, either after falling from the bridge, or during
periodic breaks in the ropes, which appear to have been repaired numerous
times.
