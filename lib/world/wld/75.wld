The Forests Edge~
   The forest appears calm and peaceful as the leaves and branches sway softly
in the wind.  The trees almost appear to dance to the songs of the birds
singing in them.  North the forest is darker and the trees much larger.  To the
south the forest comes to an end and expands into a large open field.  A trail
leads east and south.

Plot         : The town once thrived on tourism and had many profitable items.
   But a group of evil mages or clerics started going too far and rumors of
   evil things like sacrifices cause people to stop coming.  Many shopkeepers
   left when business died.  The ones that stayed learned to do without and
   went back to a more natural lifestyle, even in the fortress there were
   changes that could not be helped such as a more native attire or wearing
   things still around from the past, but where the fortress could continue as
   they did in the past they do.  Most of the people now don't even remember
   other towns and live a normal peaceful life.  The change was generations
   ago.  The order that was following the evil worship are still hidden but
   seem to be more acepted and beginning to blend into the normal lifestyle of
   many of the villagers.

Notes        : The first room , becuase of needing more forest area, is 7598 it
   only leads west.  It needs to connect to something to the east to fit on the
   map.  A lot of my area is outside, but the town is considered secluded so
   other junctions need to not be too close to the town.  The town ends at the
   coast line and if someone makes an underwater ocean area it would fit in
   perfect to my coast.  The numbers of my coast are 74-85, but in order it
   goes from the north to south 80 79 78 77 76 75 74 81 82 83 84 85.

to have been made of living trees grown standing side by side with thick trunks
and branches that weave back and forth from one trunk to the next.  In the
center of the massive gate the trail leads to a small opening.  The air is cool
and gentle, the strong floral smell begins to weaken.  Several noises escape
the gate, sounds of civilization.  A small path leads east and west.

The net is held open by two long even branches woven at the ends of the net
before being tied to the trees.  A blanket is folded and is setting in the
middle of the net.  In the center of the room a small cluster of stones,
blackened by smoke, surrounds a small fire.

further west.

building compared to the small huts.  To the west appears to be the formation

huge stone building rises high into the sky, a long set of steps lead upward.

you stare up at it you notice it has large green gems for eyes, its mouth open
as if ready to bite.  In one of its clawed hands it holds a twisted dagger.
The dagger is of fine steel and appears to have been placed in the claw after
the statue was made.

and thick.  A small group of butterflies busily flutter about in a cluster of
flowers.  A large yellow flower silhouettes one of the patches of light, for
some reason it stands alone as if the other plants fear to grow beside it.

The Taboo Way~
   This chamber is fairly large.  The hard earth is dark with spilled blood and
evil invocation.  The walls are made of smooth black marble which shimmer as
the light hits it from a torch.  Painted on the floor is a huge pentagram
inside a circle.  Black and crimson candles burn at each point of the
pentagram.  Inside the center of the pentagram is a pewter bowl.  A whisp of
smoke spirals out of the bowl carrying a foul odor.  The only exit visible is
the tunnel south.

The Top of Mount Zamba~
   The stone steps extending upward finally stop at a set of double doors.
The doors are made of thick iron mounted into the side of the mountain.  In the
center of each door is the face of a black panther snarling.  Its mouth holds a
loose iron ring.  Looking to the north and east you see the ground far below .
To the west below are jagged rocks jutting out from the side of the mountain
ending at a large body of water crashing against the side of the mountain.
The sounds of the water roars as it echos up the mountain side.  A strong wind
from the west threatens to push you over the side.  Should you climb down or
should you brave the unknown and enter the doors to the south?

   Large trees enclose this narrow strip of beach from the north around to the
east.  To the west the ocean washes up the beach and crash onto a group of
jagged rocks clustered below the trees.  To the south the sandy trail leads off
to a wider strip of beach.

   To the west the ocean rolls in and out on to the beach carrying off the top
layer of sand and leaving behind shells of various sizes most of which are just
broken pieces.  The air is salty and warm as it blows in from the west.  The
sand continues to the north and south.

A Sandy Beach~
   The sand of the beach has been dug out in several areas.  In other parts
farther away from the waters edge mounds of dirt have been packed and odd
animal tracks lead away from the mounds toward the coast disappearing into the
water.  The current here is gentle and softly caresses the edge of the bank.
The sand leads off to the north and south.

   The sandy beach drops off into a gentle slope.  The white sand is littered
with footprints and various pieces of clothing.  To the south the sand comes to
a drop off overlooking jagged rocks.  West the ocean rolls in onto the sand
gently washing away several of the footprints.  East is a large cluster of
trees.  To the north a sandy path out.

them.  The trail leads east and west.

creatures.  The trail lead east and west.

   The forest contains many different types of trees all quite beautiful.
There are some trees with large pink flowers, trees with small blue blossoms,
even the trees with no blossoms are eye catching.  A group of trees covered in
huge leaves that change in a variety of shades from a golden yellow to a
crimson red are the main species here.  The trees open into a wide gap large
enough for a row of wagons.  The ground is clear of rocks but show no sign of
wagon wheels.  The trail leads west into the forest.
