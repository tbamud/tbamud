The Church~
   Looking at the condition of the church, you wonder what kind of
bishop would allow a church's condition to get so bad.  As you look
around, you notice a sign that reads Church of the Pythons.  After a
moment of pondering, you realize that this is the home of the famed
Bishop from Monty Python.  Remember... the Bishop is watching YOU!
   Second Avenue is to the south.

Fire Station~
   This is the place where the firemen spend most of their time,
free or otherwise.  Because they hardly ever see their wives, they
particularly enjoy sliding down the pole to the fire engines.
   Stairs lead up to the firemen's quarters, Second Avenue is to
the north, and to the south is Fire Marshall Bob's office.

Firemen's Quarters~
   This is a well lived in room, and from the looks of the empty beer
cans, pizza boxes and the scattered decks of playing cards, it seems
like this room is used for more than just sleeping.  Other discarded
objects in the room prove that this room is frequented by call girls.
   The Fire Station is down the fire pole.

   Nothing here... you can go now.  The construction workers still haven't
started building on this section of the road.
   To the east is the intersection of Broadway and Second Ave and to the

you can't tell whether the smell is coming from the dump to the west,
the pigs to the south, or from the animals to the north.

tidbits of evidence looking for answers to all the killings and murders
in New Sparta.  Watch out, they might even have your name!

too, but don't stay too long 'cause the radiation can be fatal.

The Chief's Office~
   Here you are in the office of New Sparta's new Chief of Police,
Chief O'Hara, who just transferred from the Gotham Police Force.  His
office is neatly decorated with bat paraphranalia on one wall, and a
fully stocked bar on the other.
   A door to the north leads to the rest of the station.

   You get the impression that more things go on in here than is
supposed to.  South of here is the actual jail cell, where most of
New Sparta's notorious criminals reside.  There are only two ways
into the cell -- get the key off of the warden, or be convicted...

   If you are in here, for your sake you had better have a key,
or you may rot here indefinitely, as the cell door is extremely
hard to open from the inside.  Oh, and just one word of advice --
don't bend over for the soap!

The Entrance To Goethe's Garden~
   This is the entrance to Goethe's Garden, the public park
of New Sparta.  The park is named after the famous martyr and
generous donor of the land which New Sparta is built upon,
Goethe.
   To the north is the Statue of Goethe, and to the south is
Broadway.

The Statue Of Goethe~
   Much like the man, the very lifelike statue exudes an aura
of verbosity.  The Statue was constructed many years ago to
honor his genius and humanitarianism, and to his contribution
to the foundation of New Sparta.

statue goethe~
   You witness in front of yourself a monolith of manhood, a guru of grandiosity
a plethora of poetic prowess, an epitome of elegance, the sultan of sonnets, the
champion of chivalry, an embodyment of empathy, and the zenith of...
Something.  It is Goethe!  The statue of Goethe looms before you.  He is mounted
on his favorite steed, the trusty Nessumsar.  As always the sweet essence of his
poetry is dripping off his tongue.  His all-knowing eyes seem to pierce through
you.  You can't help but fell embarrassed about all your shortcomings as you
stand beside this solemn stud (not the horse silly, the man-stud Goethe!  ).

First Avenue~
   You immediatly realize that the city suddenly grew darker when
you left Broadway and it makes you feel uncomfortable.  You hear
the sounds of what you think is a war being raged off to the west
and you wonder if it is safe to find out what's going on.
   The Intersection of First and Broadway is to the east and Hell's
Kitchen is to the west.

The Entrance To Hell's Kitchen~
   As you walk in, you wonder why it is so dark here... and then
you realize either that the electric company is too afraid to come
and repair the lights or because the people here are too poor to
afford lights.  You sense the tremendous evil that lurks within and
decide that your personal safety is more important than exploring...
besides you can think of at least of a dozen better places you'd
rather be than in Hell's Kitchen.
   You decide that the only real exit is to First Avenue which is
to the east.

  You can use 'order <pet> <instructions>' to order your pets around.
  If you abuse your pet, it will no longer regard you as its master.
  If you have several pets you may use 'order followers <instructions>'

  You can name the pet you buy as : "buy <pet> <name>"

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   Make two rooms and some pets.  The rooms MUST be sequential.  If the first
room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.
