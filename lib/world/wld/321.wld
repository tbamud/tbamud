Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.

   Waves crash and slam against each other in a constant swirl of motion, spray
and foam spitting high into the air.  The sky has darkened, looking just a bit
stormy.

In the Fog~
   A dense fog has rolled in, making it hard to see for any distance.
Everything seems to have gotten very quiet, making it almost surreal in this
area.

In the Fog~
   A thick fog has rolled in over the ocean's surface, obscuring what lies ahead
and making it almost impossible to see more than a few feet ahead.  Things seems
to have gotten just a little too quiet.

A Drizzling Rain~
   The rain comes down in steady sheets of tiny raindrops.  It does not appear
that there will be any thunder or lightning any time soon, just a steady dismal
downpour.

A Gentle Breeze~
   A calming, fresh breeze blows in bring the fresh scent of the open sea and
the tang of salt with it.  The sea appears to be cooperating with travel, only
gentle swells at this point.

Among Fifteen Foot Waves~
   A blinding storm has erupted across the seas, causing the water to jump from
casual swells to the fifteen foot walls which are now completely surrounding
this area.  Rain lashes down, stinging the sea with its driving force.
