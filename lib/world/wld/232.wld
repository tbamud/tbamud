Terringham~
   You have entered the town center of Terringham.  This center is large enough
to hold hundreds of people.  In the center of the square is a large fountain
with a large dolphin statue coming out of the fountain.  The dolphin is spitting
water out of its mouth, which trickles down into the fountain below.  The ground
is made of red brick, which circles around the fountain and pans out until it
gets to the buildings.  The directions north, south, east, and west, been marked
with a different shade of brick as it looks like it cuts into the pie of bricks.
Near the buildings, you see statues of many forms, these statues seem to be
untouched by time.  At a close glance of the statues, you can make out the Gods
Rumble, Welcor, Ferret, Detta, Heiach, Shamra, Relsqui, Elaseth, and Fyre.

   The road here continues to the east and west.  The walls seem to be
untouched, and the lighting here seems to be a bit poor.  It looks as if someone

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   Make two rooms and some pets.  The rooms MUST be sequential.  If the first
room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.
