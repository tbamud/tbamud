Mist Maze Imm Room~
   This zone is just a brief randomly created maze, where the mobs randomly
  load when players enter and mobs will randomly load what the players get.
  More often than not, the players will only get coins
**  Important note **
  Any immortals entering any portion of this zone, except this room, while
  they have NOHASSLE activated will result in a flood of error messages.
  If an immortal has need to enter this zone, ensure you are prepared for
  the erroneous errors, or make sure they have NOHASSLE disabled.
** Instructions for adding this zone **
  Load object 13099 to any room where a swirling mist is appropriate using
  zedit.  Once the object is in place, the zone is ready to go.  The final
  room of the zone, should a player reach it, will lead the player out of
  the maze to room 3151.  In the stock world, that is the cemetary in South
  Midgaard.  Almost all of the rooms are not flagged as NO_MAGIC so if a
  player is desperate enough, they can always recall.

In the Mist~
   The mists swirl, sometimes obscuring your vision completely, at other times
clearing enough that you think you see the path.  Reality fades as the cold damp
mist permeates your very being.  As the wisps part, the path appears briefly but
always seeming in a different direction.  Nothing is stable yet the mist is
constant.  A pungent odor, like that of death itself, assails your nostrils.
There is no alternative but to plunge ahead.

In the Mist~
   The mists swirl, sometimes obscuring your vision completely, at other times
clearing enough that you think you see the path.  Reality fades as the cold damp
mist permeates your very being.  As the wisps part, the path appears briefly but
always seeming in a different direction.  Nothing is stable yet the mist is
constant.  A pungent odor, like that of death itself, assails your nostrils.
There is no alternative but to plunge ahead.

In the Mist~
   The mists swirl, sometimes obscuring your vision completely, at other times
clearing enough that you think you see the path.  Reality fades as the cold damp
mist permeates your very being.  As the wisps part, the path appears briefly but
always seeming in a different direction.  Nothing is stable yet the mist is
constant.  A pungent odor, like that of death itself, assails your nostrils.
There is no alternative but to plunge ahead.

   But there is something else now.  Something that wasn't there before.  Ahead
is a tree unlike any seen before.  Upon this tree grows fruit of every size,
color shape.  It is quite possibly the most amazing thing seen, as apples,
bananas and ever oranges all grow and fall from this tree at an alarming rate.
