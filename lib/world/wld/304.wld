A Grassy Field~
   You are travelling across a great grassy field.  The wind blows softly,
causing the ripe ends of the grass stalks to bob lazily back and forth.  To the
north you spy what appears to be some sort of temple, its great white walls
blazing with the light of the sun.

Before the Temple~
   The dazzling white stone walls of the temple momentarily blind you.  Great
columns are spaced evenly around the perimeter of the temple, and an arch
beckons you inside.

Under the Arch~
   Your eyes slowly adjust to the level of darkness under the protective shade
of the arch.  To the north is a great marble door, which seems to be the best
way to get inside the temple.  "Why the heck to I want to go in there ?", you
think to yourself.  You shrug your shoulders and suddenly get the feeling that
you are being watched.

   Beautiful green plants wind around bamboo poles here, leaves outfolded to
catch the sun's rays coming in from the open sky.  The smell of rich dark earth
overwhelms your senses, and a small brook winds beneath your feet.

The Upper Temple~
   You find yourself in a small room atop the stairs.  Strangely enough, this
part of the temple has decorations.  The walls are covered with murals and
furs.  A corridor leads off the the south, and the stairs offer a retreat
downwards.

Aten's Chamber~
   You are standing in a comfortable chamber.  Sunlight streams in the the open
windows, and a warm spring breeze ruffles your hair.  Thick furs cover the
stone walls and floor.  A stained oak table dominates the center of the room,
and couches line the walls.  You look out the window and are vaguely surprised
that you can't see the ground.

The Bull's Chamber~
   This room is in TOTAL dissaray.  Items seem to have been swept of the room's
numerous shelves and just dumped on the floor.  The room has an unfamiliar
smell, and you wrinkle your nose in disgust.  An great sliding window is open
to the south and leads to the balcony, and a heavy iron door is to the east.

The Dark Chamber~
   You are in a shadowy chamber, and the hairs at the back of your neck begin
to rise.  There is so little light in this room that you start to imagine
things..  Or do you?  You know for certain that you spotted a door to the west
when you first entered.
