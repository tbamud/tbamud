A Scraggly Trail~
   This trail slopes up and away from the main road to
the west.  At points the trail seems to fade into
obscurity against the gray stone and near-gray mountain
grass prevalent here.  The trail leads generally eastward
and up higher into the rocky ground.  There is a sign
here, seemingly out-of-place in this rough country.

A Scraggly Trail~
   What could barely be called a trail leads west back
down the mountainside, and down into a very small valley
where a small house sits in the middle of a well-groomed
yard.  The door to the house is open and inviting,
welcoming you for a visit.

A Groomed Path~
   You are standing in the western end of a very, very
small valley, just about room enough for the one house
standing to your east.  You can see from here that the
door to the cozy cottage is open and inviting, but the
interior seems very dark.  A path bordered by shrubberies
leads up to the structure, and ends where you are
standing; right by the easiest path back up into the
mountains.

Outside A House~
   The path you are on leads from the front door of the
cottage to your east, to the edge of the small valley
to the west.  The building seems quiet...almost too
quiet.  A small voice in the back of your head, the
same voice that has saved your life on countless
occasions, seems to be telling you that something is
very, very wrong here.

   Devastation greets your eyes.
   The forge has been blasted apart, along with most of
the back door.  Hammers, tongs, and anvils lie about in
one gigantic mess, and the smith's bed smoulders yet.
This place has been utterly wrecked and blasted apart, by
more than one man you would think from all the tracks in
the dust...

tell tale of the smith/mage Gabadiel's masterwork: a sword of unequalled power,
and two swords that came before, discarded as 'Not quite what I was working

of this tiny valley.

fairly good panoramic view to the south, including what
appears to be a small mountain village to your south and
west, and a tall, ominous peak westwards from here.

slopes leading down into different areas of the mountains.
   A giant, dark peak looks down over you to the west,
looking quite spooky indeed!

here.  The going looks somewhat dangerous, and you decide
to exercise a little caution.

a sheer wall of rock to the north.  You can climb up the
slope to the east, or continue along the flat area to the
west.  Another slope leads downwards to the south, looking
unsafe but climbable.

the plateau continues, and you think you can climb up the
steep rocky slope just west of here.  You are afforded a
good view of the lower regions of this depression, and you

somewhat safer to the north.  East the slope leads down
to a small plateau that also looks considerably safer
than your other choices.  The shale under your feet
slips badly, and you are almost thrown off balance;
this is no place to be without mountaineering equipment.

   You are standing on a point outcropping with a
beautiful view of the mountains to the north.  Far
below, you see what appears to be a foot-path climb
up to the central mountain, a peak that looks dark
and disturbing.  You get very bad vibes from that
mountain for some reason, and it doesn't seem like
a very good idea to try to find a way to get there.
   The only safe way to leave this overlook is to
the south.

Looking up, you see sheer rock walls surrounding much
of the depression, making an effective fortress of
this place.

A Cave Entrance~
   A cave leads into the heart of the mountainside, well-
lit by sconces upon the walls.  A large rock sits by
the side here, near a small firepit.  Debris litters the
area; rabbit bones, half of a broken whetstone, and random
litter.  The ground is devoid of grass, and well trodden
by many pairs of boots.  Strange that someone should live
so deep in the mountains...

light streams in from the west, accompanied by a slight
breeze, making the flames in the sconces flutter a bit
and throw stange shadows upon the walls.  This passageway
heads north and south from here, each way seeming dark and
stuffy compared to outdoors.  From the tracks in the
floor, you guess that the north is the more used.

comfortable in this strange place.  From far off you hear
the echoes of what sound to be voices.

Eastwards the passageway continues into the shadowy
recesses of the mountain uninvitingly.  The echoes of
voices are confusing you a bit, and you are not sure
whether you should try to remain quiet or not.

What a village is doing this far from civilization, and how

inhabited as well.

are to your north and south.  East-wards this road continues.

Evidently you've come during off hours, since no bar could be

of stuff.  Browse, type list, buy, sell, whatever...

Main Road~
   Nothing is going on in this section of village either.  To the
east is an actual road intersection, and to the west you see one
of the ends of this road.  A large grassy area to the south is
fenced off for a horse corral.

The Corral~
   Many horses look up at you when you enter this corral.
The horses are kept in by a big wooden fence, which they
seem quite happy to been kept in by.  You don't see anyone
around taking care of these horses, but someone is probably
close by.

The Intersection~
   You are standing in an intersection deep in the heart
of Stanneg by the Mountains.  In fact, this is the ONLY
intersection anywhere in Stanneg by the Mountain it
appears.
   There are some buildings to the north, and south, and
east, and west.  None particularly stand out from the
others.

A Small Road~
   This road runs north through Stanneg by the Mountains,
if through would be the operative word for such a motley
collection of buildings.  Westwards is a small, open-roofed
building that appears to be a farmer's market.  The road
you are on continues north, and comes to an intersection
just south of here.

A Private Home~
   The interior of this home is simple and rustic.  A
ladder leads up to the loft, where the sleeping pallets
are tucked away.  A wood-burning stove keeps the place
well heated and cozy.  A homemade rocking chair stands
crooked in the corner, draped with a old looking afghan.
This home is a nice place, very comfortable.

   This home strikes you as unbearable warm and uncomfortable.

somewhat spartan and plain; a landscape, an old hunting
bow... nothing much of interest.

well is a large building, with a large WELCOME mat outside
its front door.  Westwards you see the a road intersection
in the center of the tiny village.  Around you is a rocky
terrain in the middle of this mountain range...not very

room where food and drink can be ordered, and a set of
rickety wooden stairs lead up to the rooms are.  A thread-
bare rug lies in the middle of the floor, evidently well-
loved by a cat or two from the quantity of hair on it.

   A large fireplace warms this room in great waves of
heat, to combat the chill drafts eminating from the windows
on the west and north sides of this room.  A few benches
and tables are clustered in the center of the room, for
the use of the locals.  Fairly plain, for a frequented
gathering place.

almost unused.  The hall is plain and without any
decoration, except for a nice painting of (what else)
a mountain hanging above the stairs that lead back
down to the inn proper.

A Rocky Slope~
   This slope is fairly shallow and easy to walk on,
despite the loose shale and gravel.  To the east is a high
ridge you could stand on, and to the west is a flat area
near two trails leading up and down into the mountains.
High above you, to your west, is that ominous, dark peak,
which seems to radiating a sense of hopelessness...

A Ledge~
   This ledge overlooks a small path that leads up and
down from here.  Below, you see the path head down to a
large flat area where a small cottage lies nestled in the
mountains, smoke rising from it in a curling line.  Above,
the path seems to head towards that dark peak piercing the
sky.  You notice a few boot-tracks in the earth, seemingly
to lead down towards the cottage.

Outside Of A Cottage~
   Now that you approach closer to the cottage, you notice
that the smoke is not coming from the chimney, but rather
the gutted ruins of the building.  Something torched this
place, badly.  You see no signs of life among the wreckage.
You can enter one of the particularly large holes in the
wall to the west, with caution.

The Torched Cottage~
   This whole place is smouldering still from whatever
decided to try to burn it to the ground.  On the floor
near the center of the ruined structure is the burnt and
dessicated corpse of a man, outstretched and blackened.
There's not much to see here; whatever decided to destroy
this place did it very well.

A Mountain Trail~
   This mountain trail leads straight up into the evil
looking mountains.  High above you, one mountain peak
seems to radiate danger and fear, and the trail seems
to be leading straight up to it.  You wonder if it is
wise to continue this way...
   The trail goes even higher up to the west, and back
down to the west.

heading back down to the east would be a good idea...

Near The Peak~
   This is as close to the peak as you're going to get,
unless you use that tiny, tiny path leading up to your
north.  Up the side of the mountain you see a great cave
hollowed out, the inside pitch black.  The path leads down
the mountains to your east, which seems to be the best
place to go.

The Cave Entrance~
   You are standing in the entrance of a simply huge cave!
The size is stunning!  All around the entrance are burnt
bones and various types of wooden and metal debris.  Giant
claw marks are all along the ground, leading back deeper
into the cave.
   Two tunnels lead off from here, one up, one down.  There
are claw marks leading in either direction.

   This tunnel slopes deep, down into the mountain's heart.
The air feels still and uncomfortably warm, despite the
closeness of the cave's entrance above you.  There's a
deep, musky odor in the air, and the giant claw marks
continue downwards.

You break  out in a sweat due to the overwhelming warmth
of the air.  The musky odor has grown quite intense,
drowning out everything else in the air and making it hard
to breathe.  Something in your gut begins squirming
uncomfortably as you wonder what's ahead...

The Lair~
   This place is huge!!!  It should be considering the
dragon's great bulk.  However, instead of seeing the
customary carnage and mound of gold that one is accustomed
to seeing in a dragon lair, this one is decorated subtly
with tapestries and drapes, and other comforts of human
life.  There is even a huge-dragon sized bed -- undoubtedly
conjured to life by its elder dragon owner.
