Welcome to the Builder Academy~
   A builder is a term usually used to describe a person who designs MUD zones
for other characters to explore. Any player with motivation, ideas, and good
writing style can be a builder as well as a player. As a Builder, your job is
to create the virtual world in which players can roam around, solve puzzles,
find treasures, and gain experience. A Builder creates the rooms, objects,
mobs, shops, and triggers with which players will interact.
   If this is something you are interested in doing then you have come to the
right place. Be warned, building is not easy and will require hard work,
patience, and the ability to take constructive criticism.
   Your first task is to apply for builder status at:
@Cwww.tbamud.com@n
   When you finish and submit the application tell anyone level 32 or higher
and they will advance you to begin your training.

   If would like to check out the tbaMUD World as a player connect to tbamud.com 4000.

The Builder Academy~
   Congratulations on your new-found immortality. Now all you need to know is
how to use your new abilities. This zone describes how to create CircleMUD
areas. The intended audience is builders interested in creating new worlds.
There are a few basic rules to understand while exploring this zone and
learning how to build. Everything in @RCAPITAL LETTERS@n is something that
can be further explored by typing @RCAPITAL LETTERS@n and hitting return.

Test this out, @RHELP DISCLAIMER@n.

The Beginning~
   By simply following the different halls new builders will be taught the
basics of building on a tbaMUD. If new to immortality and building then I
highly recommend the hallway to the north for an overview of immortal commands.
For those that have a grasp on all commands listed under @RWIZHELP@n continue to
the east. TBA is constantly striving to improve upon the training process so
please use the typo and idea commands liberally.

The Builder Academy Implementation~
   Here at The Builder Academy we try not to restrict builders with rules and
regulations. But, some are required in order to make this place run smoothly.
Please realize we handle a lot of newbie builders with a very minimal staff so
be patient, learn to use the helpfiles and have fun.

Building~
   This hallway running west to east is the route you will advance after
completing each hallway leading off to the north (if there is one) @RHELP TBAMAP@n.
   The first thing all builders need to realize is that their area is not going
to be the best, and it is not going to have the best equipment or toughest mobs
in the game.  All new builders want to make a piece of equipment that is better
than any other and they all want the large group of players to remember the
trials and tribulations they went through while trying to kill a mob that they
have created.  If you are a veteran of any MUD, you know that the toughest mobs
have already been made, and to try to create a mob that is tougher is almost
impossible and will only duplicate existing mobs, or throw off the balance of
the game. So start out small and do not expect to create a perfect zone the
first time around. Do not make anything super-powerful. It will not be allowed
and you will have to redo it, wasting everyone's time, both yours and ours.

Writing Good Descriptions~
   The following help files go into the lengthy subject of writing good
descriptions.  This will also cover proper grammar and the use of the text
editor where you enter all of your long descriptions.
   The hardest part for most new builders is writing descriptions. We assume
that you are reasonably literate and know basic grammar and spelling. If
this does not describe you, we humbly suggest that you take some classes,
get a dictionary, and start learning. Proper grammar should be used at all
times. If you can write reasonably well, great! I am sure you will still
find this hallway useful. We will discuss some of the issues related to
writing specifically for a MUD, such as:

How to Use Redit~
   Room edit, or redit, is how you create, link, and describe the rooms that a
player explores. It can be used by simply typing redit in the room you wish to
edit.  If you get a message that you do not have permission to edit that zone
it is because your OLC is not set to that zone. @RSTAT SELF@n to see what your
@MOLC[]@n is set to. OLC, or on-line-creation is set to the zone number
assigned to you by the staff.  The zone number is then divided into VNUM's ##00
to ##99. For example, Zone 12 has VNUM's 1200 to 1299. These numbers are
critical; they are the identities of the rooms within the game.  They can be
used with "goto" to go to that room.
   Now, lets look at the redit menu. Type the following: @RHELP REDIT-MENU@n
That is an example of the redit menu you will see when you edit a room.
Notice how each important line has an associated help topic. To learn more
about it just see the appropriate help file. If this is your first experience
with redit read ALL the help files. @RHELP STYLISTICS@n

How to Use Oedit~
   Now you will learn the intricacies of creating objects with the object editor.
Please remember that every MUD has different ideas of balance and the basics of
building you learn here should be universal, but expect limitations on objects
from your MUD administration. To further help your training we have added object
standards to all values a builder can set. This way you know what values are
appropriate and will not have to redo objects because you did not know what
values to set.
   Oedit can be used by typing "oedit <<VNUM>>".  A zone is divided into VNUM's
##00 to ##99.  For example, Zone 12 has VNUM's 1200 to 1299.  These numbers
are critical; they are the identities of the objects within the game.  It is
a good habit to start using all VNUMs from ##00 to ##99 consecutively.
   Start off by checking out the oedit menu. Type @RHELP OEDIT-MENU@n
That is an example of the oedit menu you will see when you edit an object.
Notice how each important line has an associated help topic. To learn more
about it just see the appropriate help file. If this is your first experience
with oedit read ALL the help files.

How to Use Medit~
   Next you will learn how to create mobiles with the mobile editor. Mobs are
the non-player characters within the game (NPC's). With medit you will be able
to create a mob and modify all of its stats (statistics), flags, and settings.
   Mobile edit, or medit, is how you create the monsters a player can interact
with.  Notice I use the word interact.  Every mob should not be made for just
killing.  There can and should be a variety.  For example, one mob could be
made for high experience value, another for gold, another for a unique object,
another to fill a storyline, another as part of a quest.  The options are
limitless, especially with triggers, mobs are meant for much more than just
killing.  Medit can be used by typing "medit <VNUM>".
   Type @RHELP MEDIT-MENU@n That is an example of the medit menu you will see
when you edit a mobile. Each line has its own help topic you should also read.

How to Use Zedit~
   Zedit is what is used to load mobiles and objects into rooms. Every zone
goes through a zone reset, each one depending on how you set it. Upon a zone
reset all rooms, mobs, and objects will reload if they are no longer present.
   Most new builders think mobs and objects are loaded by the "load" command.
This is not how it is done. Instead you use zedit in each room you wish a
mob or object to load. This way whenever the zone resets it will execute the
zone commands to load all of your mobs and objects.
   Zone edit, or zedit, is how you control how mobiles and objects are
integrated within the zone to create an inhabited world. Using "load obj
<VNUM>" does not ensure that the mob will always be there, in fact if someone
kills it or the mud reboots it will be gone. So you need to load mobs and
objects through zedit.
   It can be used just like redit, by simply typing zedit while you are in the
room you wish to edit or "zedit <<VNUM>>." Now, lets look at the zedit menu.
@RHELP ZEDIT-MENU@n.  That is an example of the zedit menu, be sure to read
the related helpfiles on each menu option.
   Zedit contains zone settings, followed by a series of reset commands. Each
time a zone is reset, the server executes all the commands in order from
beginning to end. All zones are reset when the server first boots, and
periodically reset again while the game is running.

How to Use Sedit~
   Shops are stores within the mud that players can list the items for sale
and then buy or sell from. Shops are one of the more complicated aspects of
building and should not be attempted until you are comfortable with the other
forms of OLC (except trigedit).
   When you make a shop I suggest you use the shop vnum that matches the room
you wish the shop to be in. For example, say I want a shop in room 1333. I
would sedit 1333 to create that shop. Now, let us look at the sedit menu.
Type the following: @RHELP SEDIT-MENU@n. That is an example of the sedit menu
you will see when you edit a shop. Notice how each important line has an
associated help topic. To learn more about it just see the appropriate help
file. If this is your first experience with sedit read ALL the help files.

How to Use Trigedit~
   The hall to the north will show you how to use the trigger editor. Trigedit
is the most advanced form of OLC we have to offer. It is the hardest, but also
the most rewarding. If you are looking to pour life into your mobs, enliven
your rooms or just make your objects special? This can all be done with
trigedit. Have fun with the power of (minor) coding!
   Like all the hallways before use this hallway in conjunction with the help
files: @RHELP TRIGEDIT-MENU@n and the commands @RTLIST@n and @RTSTAT@n commands.
Do not attempt to use trigedit until you complete your trial vnum and are
assigned a zone. Remember you must disable @RNOHASSLE@n. Triggers will not work
on you otherwise.

Planning~
   The ideas discussed in the help files below are tried and true. Though they
may not work for everyone, they will for the majority. Learn from others
mistakes and understand the planning required to make a good zone. Building a
great zone takes many things; such as time, patience, good grammar/spelling,
knowing how to balance your zone, a lot of work, and most importantly
planning. Now this all may sound like a lot to do, but I can assure you that
with this zone, and the help of others, you can do this.

Immortal Commands~
   As an immortal you have some new commands available to you.  To see all
of your immortal commands simply type @RWIZHELP@n. Every command in the game
has a help entry. So the best way to learn how to use all these commands is
by simply typing @RHELP <COMMAND>@n. This will bring up some information
about the command. For example, this is what you will see if you type
@RHELP NOHASSLE@n:

@WNOHASSLE      -------->> help topic

Usage: nohassle         ---------->> what you need to type to do it.

   Toggles a flag to prevent aggressive monsters from attacking and also prevents
immortals from firing triggers. If you wish to test triggers you must turn
nohassle off.  -->> description

See Also: HOLYLIGHT, ROOMFLAGS  ------->> other related commands in help file.
@n
   Now is the time to practice all of your immortal commands, make sure you
understand what they do and how they can be used. Read all the help file
entries on every command!!! Do not worry too much about redit, oedit, medit,
zedit, sedit, and trigedit. We will get to those later. Know how to use all
the commands available to you.

Another Example With Quest Variables~
   These triggers are a little more complex.  The complexity gives the builder
more flexibility.  By setting a variable on a player you can later call on
these variables.  The most basic usage is to set a quest as completed when the
player is done.  Another use would be to set something else like
player_can_breathe_water and prevent a player from entering a certain room
unless they have this variable set.  To see what variables are set on a player
simply stat that player.  @RSTAT SELF@n.

   War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and
degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is
worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to
fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a
miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by
the exertions of better men than himself.

   A broad mosaic walkway wraps around the natural hotsprings in this cavernous
room.  Three large chandeliers are suspended from the domed ceiling and their
sparkling light dances on the surface of the bubbling hotsprings.  As you peer
into the water images begin to form from out of the depths, coalescing into a
vivid scene.  Your heart begins to pound and your breathing becomes deeper as
you watch the images taking shape in the turbulent liquid.  Your mouth becomes
dry as you see yourself in the watery panorama ...  And time stands still for
just one moment ...  As you see your future in the depths ...

The End of the Beginning~
   For those of you who have read this far and actually made something out of
it, Congratulations. You have the patience to become a builder and make
CircleMUD zones. If you wimped out or skipped some areas then please MUDmail
me why. @RAT POSTMASTER MAIL RUMBLE@n. Also, please MUDmail or email me any
questions, comments, concerns, or suggestions about this zone.  What did I do
wrong, forget, misspell, anything! If you have something to add feel free to
MUDmail or email me. @RHELP EMAIL@n.

   This area is a culmination of help files I have come across and my own
experiences in the CircleMUD community. I thank all those before who have
helped in the creation of this masterpiece. Special Thanks to Welcor,
Elaseth, Manivo, Snowlock, and Lance for their additions.

Remember, MUDding is fun!
