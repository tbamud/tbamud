Guard Post~
   The wooden barrier that bars progress south along the road to Westlawn's is
not formidable enough to truly keep people off Westlawn's property.  Indeed -
were it not for the guards which are stationed here, one could easily ride off
the road and go around.

   Keep of Baron Westlawn by Kaan for Dibrova
Level: 25-30
90 rooms
42 mobs
40 objs
Connector zones: The King's Highway
This is one of eight main baronies that lie within the open plains
area that the King's Highway runs through. The main exports of this
Baron's land are beer and horses. He is a warrior baron to the core,
his soldiers finely tuned and he himself a fine warrior who could
drink any man under the table.

Road Through Westlawn's Fields~
   Tall, waving crops line both sides of the road, the main export of this area
being grain, since it is so easy to grow.  Westlawn is a known brawler and
tactician, farming is not exactly his strong point - the running part of his
estate that he leaves to be tended by his servants.

Road Through Westlawn's Fields~
   The road runs through the center of Westlawn's property which is mainly used
for the growing of grains and barley.  Not only are these two crops easy to grow
for a man who knows next to nothing about farming, but they are essential to two
parts of Baron Westlawn's life that he does know quite a lot about - horses and
drinking.  The King's Highway lies north of here, the way into Westlawn's estate
lies south.

Road Through Westlawn's Fields~
   Just to the south lies the area of Westlawn's property which he has given
over to the servants he employs which work his fields.  They are the common folk
of the area, the people who scratch a bare living from the coffers of the Baron,
but are not in any way mistreated and of course may leave of their own volition
at any time.  To the north is the main highway.

A Muddy, Rutted Section of the Road~
   The homes of the many common folk who live here on Westlawn's estate lie to
the west, their shoddy hovels and crude huts looking dirty and ill-kept.  The
road also takes a turn for the worse at this point, the evidence of much traffic
and little upkeep obvious due to the many potholes and ruts in it.  The road
travels north and south.

Rutted Roadway~
   The road continues north and south, the ruts of wagons and horse hooves
making it very bumpy and hard to travel.  The road is also perpetually wet from
the slops and waste of the folk who live in the area on the west side of the
road.  The road runs south toward a large barn or north toward the highway.

Muddy Roadway~
   The mud from the yards of the huts and shacks which lie west of here has
spilled out into the roadway, making it very soft and hard to travel upon.  It
does not appear that any effort is taken in the upkeep of the road or the hovels
which lie to the west.  The road continues north and south.

Worn Roadway~
   The road continues past the homes of the less fortunate in this area, the
hovels and shacks of the poor folk who work dawn until dusk to keep the crops
plentiful.  To the south is a large red barn, is paint flaking away, the walls
partially askew from poor craftsmanship.

Worn Roadway~
   It seems that you stand in the middle of 'town'.  On the east side of the
road is a shoddy building, its walls made from scrap wood, the windows paneless
and barely square by any means.  Continuous sound comes from the inside of the
building, though, suggesting it to be an inn or tavern for the locals.  On the
west side are more of the homes of the commoners and to the south the road bends
to the east.

   The road bends to the east around the inn to the northeast and the barn to

slightly crooked on its slider.  To the west is a fenced in pasture where a few
sickly-looking cows wander about.

visible to the southeast.  To the west is the place of the common folk, where
they live and work.  There is a rackety wooden door in the wall of the inn on
the north side of the road.

   The bridge which crosses the water below is certainly wide enough to
accomodate heavy traffic, but whether or not it could hold the heavy traffic
which might cross over it is another story.  It groans and creaks with your
crossing, slightly shaking as you move about on it.  The road bends to the south

Muddy Road Before the Keep~
   The keep of Baron Westlawn lies to the east, a crudely imposing structure
which does not appear to be in any sort of disrepair but is certainly not
pleasing to the eye.  It is one of those great examples of function over form.
To the north is a bridge and the road which leads back to the main highway.

Quite fitting for the home of the warrior Baron.

Inner Yard~
   People move and bustle all about this place in a general buzz of activity.
Westlawn must not be much of a fan of lazy or slow movers because no one looks
as if they are taking their time, but walking about with a steady stride, with
purpose.  This inner yard is completely walled in, the only doors are the one
which lies just to the west, the exit, and one other which is built into the
eastern wall a short distance away.

   This is one of the most nasty smelling inns you ever have had occasion to
visit.  There is a layer of grime, mud and grease on the floor which makes
footing relatively dangerous and a coating of dirt on every table.  A bar lies
on the east wall, behind which a man in a grubby smock serves drinks and food.

floors are of wood planking, rough hewn and full of potential splinters and
covered in the mud that gets tracked in from the yard outside.  A small table is

   The walls of this crude shelter are made from the leftovers of the crops

most the wooded areas have been cut down to provide more room for growing crops
for the Barons.  Gaps in the walls and ceiling make it only slightly better than
being outside - a steady breeze flows through.

   The hallway is a high, arched affair made from stone and mortar.  It rises at
least fifteen feet at its highest point, twelve at the lowest along the walls.
The floor is dented and gouged from the tread of many hooves upon it - it seems
that the Baron has no qualms about leading his fine steeds through this section
of his home.  The hall meets with another hall just to the east, the courtyard
lies to the west through a set of heavy double doors.

what would be called a mess hall in this place.  A thick, wooden table runs the
entire length of the hall, one which could easily seat a score and a half of men
at dinner and then some.  There are nightly feasts here at this table, feasts
that everyone in the keep is invited to and usually attend.  Much revelry,
singing and baudy jokes are told throughout the evenings - a favorite past time
of the Baron's.  On the east wall is the door into the kitchen, where wonderful
smells emanate all day long - there is always something cooking in this place.

Hall of Feasting~
   A thick, wooden table runs the entire length of the hall, one which could
easily seat a score and a half of men at dinner and then some.  There are
nightly feasts here at this table, feasts that everyone in the keep is invited
to and usually attend.  Much revelry, singing and baudy jokes are told
throughout the evenings - a favorite past time of the Baron's.

The Head of the Table~
   This is the Baron's spot at the table.  He had it purposely designed that he
could make a grand entrance to his seat of honor on a nightly basis, walking
slowly and deliberately past all who would dine at his table.  His chair is, of
course, slightly raised from the rest of the chairs at the table - not that he
needs the height.  Rumor has it, the baron is close to seven feet in height.

The Kitchen~
   This huge room is in a perpetual state of panic, what with the known appetite
of Baron Westlawn and all.  There are three separate brick ovens which are
always lit and running, always cooking something at all times - even in the dead
of night.  Cooks run here and there, constantly making sure that nothing burns
and nothing spoils.

Soldier's Barracks~
   All of the single men who are part of the Baron's barbaric fighting force are
given quarters in this large room.  There are bunks lined in straight, perfect
rows, all of them clean and crisp.  The baron always makes it a point to stop
into this room at least once a day so that he might make sure that no soldier of
his lives like a pig.  There are severe penalties for slovenly behavior.

Arms Cache and Smithy~
   Donld works tirelessly, day after day making sure that all existing weapons
and armor are kept in perfect condition.  On top of that chore, he crafts all
metal-work within the keep, shoes horses and new weapons for the Baron to test
out.  Donld is not Westlawn's right-hand man but he is damn near close.

   Strange that guards would be posted here, already within the keep and at a
place which a person must already have made through all others in the keep.
The general's horses are a matter of pride for him, such strong pride that he
guards them jealously from intruders.
