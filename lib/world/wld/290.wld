The Entrance To The Lizard Lair Safari~
   This is the opulent entrance to the exciting Lizard Lair Safari Park.
Around you stand many other adventurers awaiting their chance to try their luck
in the quest set before them.  And you.  This quest consists of the recovery of
the Golden treasure in the depths of the lair of the lizardmen.  If you wish to
test your luck, you can push your way through the exit to the south...  If not,
you can leave the Safari Park to the east.  There is a large sign here.

sign large~
   The sign reads as follows:

   This area is not suggested if your character is less than 15th level
   since there are several tough aggressive monsters.  There are one or
   two essential skills to have... either a knock spell or item, or the
         ability to pick locks.  If you are LUCKY you might find
                  an item to open locks....

The Lizard Lair Safari was originally merely the example area
included with the Builders' Handbook, but since so many people
use it, it was decided to release the area in its own right.
*
The lair consists of 18 rooms.  Edit the following room:
#17 (exit north to the rest of the world)
*
The mobs in this area were built on a -100 (good) to 100 (bad) armor
class range.  Remove the extra '0' if you don't need/want it.

The Quest Preparation Room~
   In this room are various items of preparation for the upkeep of the quest.
A guide explains to you what the object is: To get the gold.  Looking around,
you see that the exit to the north has disappeared and you are left with only
the one exit down...  Into the water.  As you ready yourself to begin the
quest, the guide gives you a potion and tells you to quaff it.  You do so and
feel like your movements are easier, and much more free.  The guide suddenly
vanishes and you begin the quest.

The Conjuring Chamber~
   This large room is dominated by a whirlpool.  There are two exits.  To the
east you can see a door and to the west you can see a waterfilled hallway
stretching off.  The whirlpool is threatening to pull you down, but you are
certain that you would drown in it.

   This large room is rather large.  A throne sits on the east wall below a
hole in the ceiling.  The throne almost dominates the room.  No one is sitting
in it.  The wall is decorated to look like pillars surround the room.  The
annex is to the west whilst you are not sure what is above.
