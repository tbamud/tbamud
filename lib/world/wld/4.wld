Jade Forest (Description Room)~
   The Jade Forest is a simple zone, laid out for levels 10-15 approximately.
The majority of it is forest, with a small village, some trails, and a river.
There are a couple of shops, but these need stocking with items really.
Descriptions are very basic and could do with fleshing out.

The Jade Forest~
   The shadows of the trees seem to engulf their surroundings.  The light in
here is extremely scarce, allowing very little to be visible.  Tall blades of
grass wave drearily back and forth, lushly coating the ground as if this were
swampland.

The Jade Forest~
   Several colorful plants blossom prettily, their vibrant hues only visible
now and again from their hiding place in the grass.  The plant life here is so
abundant that it completely obscures any trail, making it very easy for a
traveler to become lost.

   A large patch of weeds grows here, their thick stems and leaves covered with
a fine coating of hairy bristles.  They loom high into the air, creating an
ideal hiding spot for creatures or lost travelers.

   Weeds cover the ground in a thick entwined tangle, their vine-like stems
weaving around each other as if laying a netted trap.  It would be very easy to
become ensnared here, and lingering is probably not the wisest of ideas.

   Stepping out from the weeds, a large clearing opens up, pale trees standing
sentry around its borders.  High above, beams of sunlight can be seen making
their way through the branches of the trees.  The song of some nearby birds
fills the air with joyful sound.

have done so.

seems to stretch deeply down into the earth, offering no glimmer of light or
what may lie inside.

out of view.

   The forest seems to get thicker here.  The trees are much more fuller,
sheltering the ground from the light of the day.  Since the light here is
scarce, its not possible to see the source of several scuffling noises just off
the side of the path.  The south way appears to lead into the start of a garden.

Garden~
   This isn't exactly a carefully groomed garden.  Wild and untamed, it is more
tangles of greenery and shrubs than any kind of flower arrangement.  The ground
is littered with loose rocks and pebbles, making it difficult to walk on without
tripping.

silently through the decaying pieces of wood.

deep well of mud until immediately upon it, due to the dark shadows obscuring

seems the forest is much bigger than it appears from the outside.  Just up ahead
to the north can be seen a bridge made from logs bound together with twine.
Maybe there is a stream underneath it.

   A large bridge stands immediately ahead.  The long rotting logs that have

bubbling fumes waft into the air, filling it with an overpowering stench.  As
the murky water bubbles past, it can be seen to be green and as thick as
pudding.

road becomes immediately visible.  It appears to be going directly into the
village.  There is a small house lying off to the east.

Hidden Village~
   A dusty patch of tangled weeds makes up the entrance to a small house.  It
appears to have been abandoned some time ago.  The windows and the door have
been boarded up, keeping people from entering, or even peering inside.

   The sound of rushing water fills the air, spray misting up from a rather
large looking stream.  The water swirls chaotically with foam and mud, several
small fish can be seen swimming about just beneath its surface.

Weapon;Shop!"  A few plain weapons lie bundled on the floor, wrapped in cloth as
if there is little use for them.  The shop itself appears in a state of
disrepair, a few long cracks splitting the wooden structure, allowing green
moulds to grow in the damp recesses.
