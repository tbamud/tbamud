   The entrance to the first tower lies here.  It is a large archway where
guards seem to be checking citizens as they enter.  There is a pathway that
leads east to the second and seemingly taller tower.  This tower seems to be
much wider than the other tower though.

through here and changes instantly into an ivory pathway, and the staircase

the leaves are green!  The people gather around this mysterious tree and wonder
why it could be such a bizarre color.  There are many brown footprints along the

Inside the Forest~
   The path does not follow into the forest and all that shows you a way are
torn down red trees and flattened red grass with leaves and twigs crunching on
the ground.  The noises of animals running around are now followed by noises of
things attacking animals, and making them run around.  One stump off of the
'path' is rather large compared to the other tree stumps.  There is a blockade
of trees that seems to block any further movement.

trunks stretch up for a long distance and suddenly disappear within an
