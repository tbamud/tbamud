Wide Road Through the Foothills~
   A very well-used roadway leads west into the foothills.  It has been recently
cleared and looks to be a fairly safe direction to take.  To the east lies the
path back toward the main road near Midgaard and Jareth.

This was a zone I had to sort of build off the cuff. It was when we
started getting a larger influx of new players and needed this part-
icular level range of eq. I slapped it together in less than a day
and had it ready for play immediately. All things considered, its not
a bad zone for what it was created for.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
   The road continues on through the foothills to the east and the west.  On
either side of the road are the rolling hills of the area, their grassy slopes
broken only once in a while by trees and bushes.  It is truly a beautiful area
of the world here in the foothills of Jareth.

At the Castle Entry~
   The castle door lies west from you, the way in flanked by huge, proud banners
of the Lord and Lady of this place.  Looking off to the east, you can see why
this place might be a nice visit for some of the more affluent members of
society - the rolling hills and the lush scenery give a very serene, peaceful
feeling.

Foyer~
   This small, enclosed area holds the many coats and overboots of the guests
here in the Castle.  Doors leading into the interior of the castle lie on the
north, south and west sides.  The door on the east sides does, of course, lead
to the outdoors.

Short Hallway~
   This is hardly even big enough to be called a hallway in itself, however
hallway it is.  A door lies on the south wall, another such door lies to the
north only a short distance away.

The Lord's State Room~
   As if the Lord of this manse would ever truly need a state room and truly -
as if this could even fall under the category of a state room in any capacity.
Either way, it is the Lord's retreat from his Lady and from all of the guests
when he feels the need and he does feel the need often.  The fact that there is
a small bed in the far corner means nothing at all...  Does it?

The Lord and Lady's Bedchamber~
   The first, and most odd, thing that strikes you upon entry into this room is
that there is not one but two beds set apart from each other.  They are both
quite comfortable seeming, but not anywhere near each other in the room.
Possibly the Lord and his Lady do not enjoy each other's company as much as they
show in public?

The Main Hall~
   The ceiling of this enormous chamber rises high into the upper reaches of the
castle, its domed roof at least a good hundred feet above your head.  To the
north is the grand ballroom, a room used on an almost nightly basis where the
Lord and Lady entertain their guests.  To the south is the kitchen.  A door lies
in the west wall.

for any who might wish to make merry - no matter what the time of day or night.
The main hall lies to the south.

The Back Exit~
   The Lord - that sneaky bugger - has a nice in and out way for the ladies in
waiting to come and visit him any time he pleases.  Must be that his State Room
sees a bit more action than it appears - and that would explain the bed.

Kitchen~
   The cooks of the castle labor daily, round the clock, to keep good eats on
the tables in the grand ballroom and here in the kitchen itself.  It is not
uncommon for a stray guest to come shuffling on, half sleeping and drunk to grab
something from the counter or out of the stove.  The cooks don't mind - that's
what they are here for.

The Rolling Foothills~
   All around lie the rolling green hills of this area.  It is hard to see very
far in any direction due to the fact that there are a great many hills that
obscure vision, but what you can see is beautiful.

A Side Path~
   This path leads north along the castle walls to the stables where all guests
keep their steeds.  To the south is the entryway into the castle and in all
other directions lies the splendor of the rolling foothills that surround this
place.

A Side Path~
   The path ends here, as well as the castle wall.  On the north side of the
path lies a barn, mostly used for the storage of hay and grain to feed the
animals of the guests.  On the west side is the stable where the animals are
kept.

Barn~
   It looks as if some of the more raggedy types are given housing out here in
the hay barn - and on a regular basis - while their more affluent masters stay
within the castle.  There is an enormous amount of hay and grain stacked neatly
about the place, some of it made into comfortable beds.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
   The road continues on through the foothills to the east and the west.  On
either side of the road are the rolling hills of the area, their grassy slopes
broken only once in a while by trees and bushes.  Off to the west, the pennants
of a castle can be seen poking above the hill lines which block your sight.
Obviously, someone owns these lands upon which you travel and lives just west of
here.

Wide Road Through the Foothills~
   You come round a slight curve in the roadway and get your first solid glimpse
of the castle which lies only a short span away.  It is a well-kept place, one
which appears to be frequented by many as the hedges are all neatly trimmed and
the banners which fly from the tall masts on the ramparts and which hang from
either side of the grand entry are fresh and clean.  The roadway runs east and
west.

Cold Storage~
   The costs involved in maintaining this room is really quite amazing.  Every
single day, a man drives his cart out to the frozen sea at the fringes of the
land where the minotaurs rule and brings back with him huge, solid chunks of ice
which are kept here in this sealed room where all perishable items are kept.
