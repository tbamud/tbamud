Near the Shore~
   The sea is calm near the shore, and it spreads out as far west as your eyes
can see.  The sand beneath your feet is moist, perfect for making a sand castle
if you wanted to.  To the east, there is a path that rims the shore around this
part of the sea.

the shore bordering the sea just under the horizon.  Below you, the deep blue
sea looks very deep and formidable.  Not recommended for swimmers.

   You tie your boat up near the shore and explore the island a bit.  Most of
the island is covered with a dense forrest.  Though it is very small, no more
than a few hundred meters wide, there is a small hut almost in the direct
center.  The hut is suspended about 3 meters from the ground by some wooden
poles of some sort, the only means of entrance being the rope ladder hanging
down from a hole in the center.

   @gSome believe the Jolly Roger gets its name from the French
   "Jolie Rouge" or "Red Flag."  The flag was first used by a
   French order of militant monks known as the "Poor Soldiers
   of Christ and the Temple of Solomon" -- commonly known as
   "The Knights Templar."

   Just as a terrorist to one is a freedom fighter to another,
   so it was with the Templars and their fleet. Wanted by the
   Pope and all the crowns of Europe, they came to be viewed,
   by the folks on the mainland, as pirates.
