Entrance~
   The lighted passageway continues to the north where you can hear loud
cheering and the sounds of battle.  The walls are covered with posters
announcing future bouts in the arena with some of the famous gladiators.
One poster catches your eye as it is written in blood red ink.

Spectators Entrance~
   A sign points spectators towards the stairs leading up into the balconies
while another points down towards the gladiators cells.  Yet another sign
points north towards the Gladiators Entrance.  The cheering is even louder
here.  You can barely hear the clash of weapons and screams of pain over it
all.

Gladiators Cells~
   There is noise everywhere produced by the equipment of death, here a sword
is being sharpened, there someone is heating metal plates to be used on fallen
gladiators, to see if they are dead, here rods are produced, there whips to
encourage unwilling participants.

   As unattractive as being a Gladiator may sound, a gladiator's life takes on
new meaning.  First, his status is now voluntary rather than involuntary.  He
also becomes a member of a cohesive group that is known for its courage, good
morale, and absolute fidelity to their master to the point of death.

Gladiators Cell~
   Gladiators are usually criminals, slaves, captured fugitives or prisoners of
war.  It would seem that for men of these categories it was a matter of going
from the frying pan into the fire, but that is a misunderstanding.  Becoming a
gladiator is obviously better fate than being put to death by being set upon by
wild animals or being tortured in the amphitheater.

   No doubt it was thought too dangerous to allow private citizens to own
and train gladiators who could be easily turned into a private army for
revolutionary purposes.  Therefore, with very few exceptions, gladiators are
under the control and ownership of the emperor.

Roman Ampitheater~
   The amphitheater is a microcosm of Roman society.  The seating
arrangements reflect the stratification of Roman society.  The emperor
has a special box for himself and his family.  Senators and knights sit in
their own special section.  Soldiers are separated from civilians, married
men, from bachelors.  Boys and their tutors sit together.  Women, except
for the Vestal Virgins who sit in the best seats with religious officials,
sit with the poorest men in the top tier.

   Certain criminals are executed here by being given to the wild beasts
or are forced to fight to the death as gladiators.  It also represents the
domination of Rome over its enemies: prisoners of war are either executed
or forced to fight each other as gladiators.  But for the professional
gladiator it is also a place of redemption, in which one can overcome death
by victory or by stoically accepting it.

   At last this fighting seems to have gone on long enough to satisfy,
momentarily, the mob.  The few survivors retire to get their laurel crowns,
their bags of gold and to anticipate the adulation of Rome.  Squads of
little men run into the arena with ropes and metal hooks to drag the bodies of the
dead and wounded to a mortuary cell where valuable weapons and armor are
retrieved and sorted out.  The gasping, bleeding, groaning and wounded are
finished off.  The bodies are then piled into carts to be taken and flung
into a nameless common grave.

   Flashing swords, the clash of steel, and the first wounds arouse the
passions, the hatred and the desperate fury of the gladiators and inflame
the blood-lust of the mob.  The shouts and yells and screams of the
onlookers grow to a huge, roaring crescendo of sound as one Samnite after
another go down with their stomachs gashed open or their necks spouting
blood and one Thracian after another crumbles with a Samnite sword through
his chest.  Reinforcements are rushed in to restore the balance and to add
to the pile of bleeding, writhing bodies on the sand-strewn floor.

   Another fanfare of trumpets announces the entry of two teams of 24
gladiators in charge of two renowned trainers, themselves former gladiators
who, scarred and maimed, have somehow survived with their glory from many a
combat.  According to tradition, 24 men heavily armed as the ancient
Samnites, Rome's oldest enemies, face 24 lightly clad and lightly armed
'Thracians,' each with exposed chests.  Both teams march smartly up to face
the Emperor in his resplendent Imperial Box to shout as one man: 'Hail,
Caesar.  Those about to die salute you.'

sworn to the gladiators' oath to suffer death by fire, in chains, under
the lash or by the sword as their master might decide and to obey as a
true gladiator should.

After the solemn, long procession of civic dignitaries, priests and
performers, together with images of the gods, the entry of the Emperor
Titus across the floor of the arena is the signal for renewed frenzied
applause from the restive crowd.

crying, shouting and sweating in a deafening crescendo of noise.

     This arena is not meant for random player killing of anyone within,
but was instead made for players to challenge and fight against each other
to see who is the strongest.  Players can challenge each other in any of
the arenas.  The strongest of each class will be awarded a medal, or if
he/she is the strongest of all classes he/she will also receive the
gladiators medal.  There will only be one medal for each class and the
gladiators medal.  Who ever holds a medal MUST meet all challenges, within
one day of the challenge, or forfeit their right to keep it.  Do not make
the gods interfere.  If you can't meet a challenge for whatever reason,
simply give up the medal and win it back at another time.  If you are
going to be gone for more than a week, junk the medal and inform the gods
so other players can compete for it.  Player looting and Player stealing
is NOT allowed. Matches can be played to the death or the first to flee.
Either way the loser, if he has the medal, must give it to the winner.
The gods will give out the medals to the first champions.
After that we expect the players to handle it.
Again, don't make the gods interfere!
