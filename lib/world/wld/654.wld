Atrium - 1 First Street~
   This is the atrium for a compact house on First Street.  It's a small
room, protected from the elements, where people wait for the owner to let
them in.  It would not be a good idea to leave your things here because
they probably wouldn't be here very long.

   What?  You're still here?  Maybe the owner doesn't want to see you.

   This room is a convenient space where the owner of the house can leave things
to have them protected against crashes and reboots.  If this is a vacant house,
do not leave your things here.  Only owned houses are protected.

   Guests can also leave things.  If this is your house, typing 'house' with the
name of a player will add that player to your guest list if the player is not on
the list, or will remove the player from the guest list if the player is already
on the list.  The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD,
Although he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.
Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on your
house's guest list.

Inside 9 First Street~
   This room is a convenient space where the owner of the house can leave things
to have them protected against crashes and reboots.  If this is a vacant house,
do not leave your things here.  Only owned houses are protected.

   Guests can also leave things.  If this is your house, typing 'house' with the
name of a player will add that player to your guest list if the player is not on
the list, or will remove the player from the guest list if the player is already
on the list.  The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD,
Although he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.
Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on your

Atrium - 10 First Street~
   This is the atrium for a compact house on First Street.  It's a small
room, protected from the elements, where people wait for the owner to let
them in.  It would not be a good idea to leave your things here because
they probably wouldn't be here very long.

   What?  You're still here?  Maybe the owner doesn't want to see you.

   This room is a convenient space where the owner of the house can leave things
to have them protected against crashes and reboots.  If this is a vacant house,
do not leave your things here.  Only owned houses are protected.

   Guests can also leave things.  If this is your house, typing 'house' with the
name of a player will add that player to your guest list if the player is not on
the list, or will remove the player from the guest list if the player is already
on the list.  The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD,
Although he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.
Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on your
house's guest list.

Atrium - 8 First Avenue~
   This is the atrium for a compact house on First Avenue.  It's a small
room, protected from the elements, where people wait for the owner to let
them in.  It would not be a good idea to leave your things here because
they probably wouldn't be here very long.
