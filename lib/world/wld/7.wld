Along the Stream~
   The small stream grows to the West into a respectable river.  The stream has
eroded the bank walls and the only way to continue is into the stream itself.
A field opens to the East and a small outpost is visible.

In the River~
   The current in the river is strong but still manageable.  The river banks are
well above your head on either side and look unpassable.  The river bends to the
south into dangerous rapids.  A small shack lies to the west.

An Old Shack ~
   This run down wood shack has been looted of anything valuable long ago.  It
is now covered large amounts of dust and cobwebs.  A few broken pieces of wood
furniture and other debris litters the floor.

The Forest Arden~
   The forest of Arden stretches in all directions, consisting of towering oaks
and unknown wildlife.  A path leads north and south into the forest.  There is a
gilded plaque affixed to a boulder.

   Let it be known that Arthur, King of the Britons, seeks to form the company
of the Round Table.  All knights of valor and virtue are summoned to this august
company in Camelot.

Entrance~
   Fine stonecraft and workmanship has created this picturesque fortress.  A
portcullis gapes open invitingly.  Several guards inspect all passers-by.  A
small ferry is available to cross back to the mainland.

Courtyard~
   The castle courtyard bustles with activity.  Several people are hustling
about their daily business.  The courtyard extends in all directions except to
the east which leads to the gate of the castle.  A steady flow of peasants
merchants and a few nobles pass by.

Courtyard~
   The citizens are going about their daily lives.  The center of the courtyard
is crowded with activity.  The people seem to be wary and distrustful of each
other.  A knight strolls through the courtyard and the peasants and merchants
stare at his back with a look of hate after he passes.  They do not seem to be
very happy.

Courtyard~
   The people rudely elbow their way through the crowd and seem to have no time
for manners.  The impressive castle walls surrounding the courtyard loom high
overhead providing a sense of security.  A couple of beggars look up imploringly
hoping for some charity but everyone ignores them.  To the west lies the main
entrance to the castle.

Main Hall~
   The castle entrance is well lit with torches lining the wide hallway.
Tapestries of battles and portraits of rulers line each wall.  The castle proper
is to the west or the courtyard is to the east.

Audience Chamber~
   Dozens of chairs form a semicircle around a throne to the south.  The vast
room only has a few people in it.  None of them look like they are of any
importance.

   A path through the room weaves between the numerous chairs.  To the south,
the floor slopes down to a intricate throne plated in gold.  A page scurries
past as he runs one of his errands.  Further to the east and west you see exits
while the throne lies to the south.

Audience Chamber~
   This large chamber is supported by several columns.  Chairs are crowded
together in rows, all facing the throne to the south.  Several colorfully
dressed nobles are discussing important matters amongst themselves, even a few
are involved in heated discussions.  Probably just the usual bickering about who
owns what land.

Cobblestone Road~
   A large inner wall splits the castle in half.  It is used as a second line of
defense in case the castle's defenses can not hold the outer wall.  The outer
wall is set aside for the poor quarter while the wealthier inhabitants crowd the
inner circle.

Cobblestone Road~
   A small pass is cut through the inner wall allowing access to both halves of
the castle.  The stone walls shine a bright white from heavy polishing and the
massive blocks fit together seamlessly.  To the west a fountain flows underneath
a large statue of Uther Pendragon.

Cobblestone Road~
   This cobblestone road seems to bisect the entire city of Camelot.  Pennants
fly from the towers high above and all of the buildings gleam of white stone.
Several knights seem to be coming and going to the North.

sounds of women laughing and gossiping.

Cobblestone Road~
   The white walls of the castle are almost blinding.  The flags and pennants
snap in the wind.  Everything seems perfect except for the fact that the general
mood in the castle seem to be depressing.  A tall fence to the south blocks the
view, but not the sound, of men on horseback.

Knights Way~
   A steady stream of traffic flows from the south.  The sounds of training can
be heard and there is some excitement in the crowd.  Several knights in full
combat gear are among the crowd.  It is easy to pick out those who won and those
who lost recently.

   The towers of Camelot loom above to the North.  Their gigantic white stone
blocks are placed so precisely that seams are barely visible.  Pennants and
different seals adorn the spires and walls.

Cobblestone Road~
   The cobblestone road continues east and west through Camelot with smaller
alleys travelling north and south.  A small, friendly building to the south
looks inviting.  A nice change from the majority of the people in Camelot.

Cobblestone Road~
   The glamor of Camelot is not reflected by the people in the streets.
Everyone seems subdued and to have accepted some fate they did not want.  It is
as if the spirit had been taken away from the city.

   Massive towers to the north block the light and leave this area in shadows.

place in Camelot having a good time.

West Lane~
   A gate in the west wall is boarded, chained, and locked shut.  The hinges are
rusted and look like they haven't been used for a very long time.  A dirt path
follows the wall to the north and south.

Boat Launch~
   A massive lake is partially visible through the dense fog.  A long, narrow
boat is tied up to a small dock here.  A cloaked figure is sitting in the back,
holding a long pole.  This boat looks to be a ferry between the shore and some
unseen destination through the fog to the west.

   The boat slowly moves across the rough surface of the lake.  A strong wind
blows from the north but not enough to dispel the fog.  The owner of the boat
slowly pushes the boat onward with his pole.  The fog is too thick to discern a
destination.

entire island.  Its spires shrouded fog.  Lights are visible in several windows
and the noise of its inhabitants echo across the still lake.

Open Field~
   The field continues north and south with no end in sight.  Due east stands
the massive castle resting in the middle of the lake on a small island.  The sky
looks darker to the north and you catch a scent of death and decay from a gust
of wind in that direction.
