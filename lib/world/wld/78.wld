Narrow Path~
   Dust devils swirl around your ankles as you continue your journey southerly.
Tall, majestic fir trees line the path on each side giving relief from the hot
sun.  Strange sounds echo in the trees as animals call out to those of their
own kind.  Northward lies the Western Highway and to the south you can make out
what seems to be a small village.

tree fir~
   Tall and stately, the fir trees sway gently in the breeze.  The tops reaching
seemingly endlessly toward the heavens with branches so heavily laden with moss
the lower ones droop to the ground.

Narrow Path~
   The path becomes a somewhat cobbled stone road, stray stones litter the
pathway here looking as if something frightened the workers away in the middle
of their task.  A light breeze blows gently from the south.  Gazing at the
horizon, tops of chimneys can be seen.  You get an eerie feeling you are being
watched.  The path runs north and west, westerly you can make out the sounds of
merchants calling out their wares.

Village of Gideon, Gate~
   Standing before you is the gate leading to the Village of Gideon, open wide
and seemingly beckoning you to enter.  Smells of home cooked meals drift on the
breeze and you can hear the sound of children playing in the distance.  The
cobbled road is well constructed and durable, looking as if each stone was
carefully hand picked and polished before being skillfully laid into the dirt.
Easterly will take you back to the Western Highway, while just through the gate
is the Village of Gideon to the south.

Village of Gideon, Mahnra Road~
   Sights and sounds fill your senses, the smells from the bakery waft lightly
on the air.  Shops dot the landscape along this busy yet peaceful road.
Children playing amongst the crowd cause the occasional shopper to almost lose
their packages.  Flowers grow in clay pots that line the road, adding to the
beauty of the village.  Butterflies dance lazily over the flowers only swept
away by the occasional breeze.  To the north lies the village gate, while
Mahnra Road continues on east and west where you will find various shops and
merchants.  To the south you hear water bubbling.

Court that leads to the village fountain.

   A young couple in love walks past you arm in arm, smiling at each other and
oblivious to your presence.  An old man in a rocking chair sits watching them
from a front porch with a knowing look on his face.  The homes are modest but
look well kept and each has a feeling of comfort to them.  Mahnra Road
continues to the east and west.

   The houses are sparse here but children abound, laughing merrily as the play
tag.  The flowers have all been somewhat tramped by their roughhousing.  Girls

Village of Gideon, Mahnra Park~
   An ivy covered fence surrounds this peaceful park.  Directly in the center
you see a pond with lilypads floating lazily upon it.  Frogs jump from the bank
into the pond causing a slight splash, as birds sing merrily in the trees.  A
lone fisherman sits on the opposite bank, nodding off into slumber, waiting for
the big one to bite.  Southward will take you back to Mahnra Road.

Village of Gideon, Shantrell Lane~

groomed.  The flowers grow tall under the trees that shade them from the noon
sun.  Northward is Mahnra Road and to the south is Talipia Way.

from house to house begging for scraps.  A young woman works carefully tending
her garden, stoping occasionally to fan herself.  Talipia Way continues on
westward, while to the north lies Shantrell Lane.

themselves.  Houses are scattered here and there each with a small garden to
the side of them.  Directly north the fountian lies, while Talipia Way

   Small shops are staggered along this road, some with owners sweeping their
porches, but the evidence of one hangs in the air as the smell of freshly baked
cookies make your mouth water.  Children can be seen ducking in and out from
behind trees as the echos of dogs barking ring through the air.  To the west
you see the baker's shop, eastward the continuation of Mahnra Road and
southerly Lantoom Court.

   Tall hedges border this fountain lending a feeling of seclusion and
peacefulness.  Benches are carefully placed around the bubbling fountain
providing a place for the villagers to gather and gossip.  Squirrels scurry
along the ground batting playfully at leaves and twigs, while the birds sing
their love songs soothingly.  A slight mist rises from the fountain and is
carried along the air, cooling it slightly.

coming from it.  A sign, in the shape of a loaf of bread, hangs from the post
on the porch.  The stones on the road look a bit worn as if this is a popular
spot in the village.  Northward is the door leading to the bakery.  Westward
