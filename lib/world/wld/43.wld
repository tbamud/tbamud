Polar/Walrus Zone Description Room~
   This zone is made for leveling up and experience.  Because in CW there are
little places to get good or even moderate exp.  This zone will have two
halves.  In the first half there will be penguins on a large scale in a
community in the northern wastes of Ilnyir.  The other half is the city of
eskimos, Rankit.  Rankit is ruled by a gluttonus king, Glogtar, and does little
for his kingdom.

An Ice Bridge~
   Standing on a bridge of ice you almost slip off into the gully below.  On a
bridge made of ice.  Don't lose your balance!  To the north you see the end of
the bridge, and past it is vast, white, nothing.  To the northwest you see
smoke rising from an unknown village.

An Ice Bridge~
   Standing in the middle of an ice bridge.  It looks very slippery, don't fall
off!  Beyond in the distance there is a large pillar of smoke rising of what
seems to be rising from a small village in the northwest.  You stand there and
think, Eskimos?

An Icy Trail~
   While on this winding trail totally consumed by ice and unpacked snow you
suddenly see a field to the north open up.  There are very few footprints in
the snow.  To the north there is more nothing than you ever thought there could
be.

there is a three way split in the trail.  To the north, snow, ice, and black

leading to a wide open field.  Back to the south there is a split in the trail.

   There is a fine layer of freshley fallen snow on the hard packed, very thick
snow.  There are penguins all about you.  Way to the northeast there is a large
structure made of ice.  The only thing you see for miles around is
ice,penguins, and snow.

and a couple lumps of some sort of creature roam these lands.  The penguins are

On an Ice Slick~
   Standing on this very slippery section of ice you notice a hole in the ice.
The hole is just large enough for a large dwarf through.  There is no snow at
all around the hole so the ice is practically see through.  There is an igloo
to the north which looks well tended for.  All around to the south and east is
a very large field.

reach that high!  The walls are smootheed away from constant use and wearing.
The ice here never seems to melt; for as you put your hand on it and take it
of, there is no water.  To the north is a very large, cavernous room.

   This Room is enormous!  The walls are almost translucent as you look into
them.  You see behind the Royal Penguin's throne, a chest implanted in the ice.
The throne itself seems much to big for any penguin you have come across so
far.  The ice on the ground on either side of the throne is well worn.  Those
grooves in the ice may be the posts for the loyal guards of the royal penguin.

throne chair~
   This chair made completly of ice is suberbly crafted and sqared away.  It

see it not fit to be in high places.

wall stands close to twenty feet high and, through the large iron gate set in
the ice, six feet thick.  In front of the gate stands an engraved sign.  Above
is a steep icy path that dosen't seem to be possible to climb up.

Rankit Square~
   Standing by a large fountain in this extremly busy town square the snow
starts falling very lightly and the townsfolk don't even care.  There are so
many people in this little town it could be thought impossible by many in such
a desolate place.  The snow glistings off of everything covered in it.  There
is a small post by the fountain with many numbers on it measuring the snow.
The snow reaches up to the 13' foot mark upon closer examination.  Also on the
post there is a dark line at the 18.5 mark which must be the highest snow
fall ever.  There are stairs going down from the south side of the fountain.

good and take some to their familes.  The gate is well tended and hardly makes

   This intersection doesn't have many people in it.  The roads have many
igloos along the side of them some are bigger than others possibly signifying

Eastern Gate of Rankit~
   The gate here is not as big as the main one but it should be because the
traffic here is much more than that one.  Many people going to the stores to
sell their good and take some to their familes.  The gate is well tended and
hardly makes a noise when it opens.

butcher himself as you see residents come in then run out.

   Glogtar seems to be a very large man.  His throne, sitting here, is twice
the size it should be for his size.  The snow is neatly packed around the
chamber and dug out so you have to decend several steps to come upon the Ruler
of the Ice.  Servants constantly coming in and out through a small entry way in
the west side of the wall bring their king delicacies.  To the south is the
exit and there is a small intricately carved door to te east.
