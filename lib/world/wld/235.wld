Mine Entrance~
   You step into the entrance of the mine.  Everything around you is dusty and
smells of mildew.  Some large boulders line the entrance, making you crawl over
them.  The inside of the mine looks dark and dangerous.

Dwarven Mines~
   As you enter the mine, you notice several dwarves hard at work.  They look
at you with narrow eyes as you walk past them.  The dust in here is extremely
thick, making it difficult for you to breathe.

of you.  You stumble over a large boulder, almost falling flat on your face!

Cove~
   You find yourself standing in a small cove.  It's quite dusty here, but the
air is much more breatheable.  Someone could easily hide in here and perhaps
never be found.

could the water be coming from?

   The temperature seems to drop quite a few degrees as you get deeper into the
mine.  You can hear some water dripping onto the ground before you.  It's most
likely leaking from the roof.

   You feel your feet sink into a small puddle, but it doesn't feel like water.
It's much to thick.  As you look more closely, you see that you have stepped
into a puddle of blood!  How gross!

   As you step out of the gooey puddle, you continue making your way through
the mines.  As you look to your left you can see small streaks of gold running
through the rocks.  If someone tried chipping out the gold, they would most
likely cause an avalanche.

   You feel your feet suddenly get drenched as you step into a small stream.
What a funny place to have a stream!  How could it have gotten here?  Maybe the
mine workers built it so they can drink from it.

not the worst you have smelled, so why complain?  To the north you can see a
dark tunnel.  Perhaps you should stay away from it.  It's only for the bravest

Hole in the Floor~
   There is a large hole in the floor here.  You could easily climb down into
it.  You notice a ladder suspended from the floor.  Apparently you aren't the
only one who's thought of making that trip.  The mines continue to the east.

Dwarven Mines~
   You sneak down the side of the boulder heap.  Make sure no one sees you.
You see an enormous hole in the ground to the west.  Maybe you could hide in
there.

Cove~
   You find yourself standing in a small abandoned cove.  There isn't much here
to look at, just a few stray cobwebs dangling from the dirty walls.  You notice
a few scattered pebbles lying about the floor.

Hole in the Floor~
   You begin climbing down through the floor.  Darkness surrounds you, making
you feel alone.  The ladder you're holding onto is made from rope and some old
rotted boards.  It could easily break, so be careful!

Hole in the Floor~
   The ladder comes to a sudden end.  You are forced to jump the rest of the
way down.  As you land on the ground, you feel a shooting pain rush up your
legs.  The dust that was looming in the air seems to have vanished.  Don't
complain.

Tunnel~
   You're walking through a narrow tunnel.  In the distance to the east you can
hear the shouts of several dwarves training for battle.  You must be close to
the battlefield.

Dwarven Battlefield~
   As you step out onto the battlefield, you look around at everything around
you.  This must be just a practice battlefield.  You notice that the floor is
made from concrete and it's heavily stained with blood.  There are several
torches hanging from the wall, illuminating the room with a soft glow.  The
soilders barracks are to the south.

Battlefield Gates~
   A set of large brass gates stands before you.  The gates reach up to the
ceiling, and are perhaps the best part of the mines.  By far the most
beautiful.  By the looks of it, the gate has never been closed.  You can hear
men shouting and grunting inside.  There is an aide room to the east.  The
battlefield is to the south.  Enter with care.

Aide Room~
   This is where the dwarven soilders come for aide when they are hurt in
battle.  There is a long shelf up against the southern wall piles high with
bandages and splints.  There is a faint odor of blood in here.  It almost makes
you gag.

Tunnel~
   You're standing in a narrow tunnel thats running east and west.  To the west
you spot a house made out of the stones from the mines.  The workers must live
in there.  The house looks like a cave and has no windows.  How could anyone
live in a place like that

   You're standing in the entrance to the house.  The door that was once here
has rotted away and was never replaced.  You don't feel very safe here.  There
are numerous torches nestled into the stone walls.  Some of them have burned
out and need to be relit.  T

Stairwell~

fresh footprints on the steps.  Doesn't anyone clean in here?  The stairs look
fairly sturdy, but are extrememly uneven.  Someone could easily fall and break
their neck.

   There is an emormous hole before you.  It's not very deep, but you would
most likely get hurt if you attempted to walk through it.  The mines continue
to the north, west, and south.

There is a thin layer of dust on the floor.  All the bunks are made, but you
wonder when this room was last swept.  The training room is to the south.

There are numerous torches dangling from the stone walls, lighting the room.
There is a small passageway to the south.  Where could it lead?

feet is white and swirled with shades of gray.  Some are so dark they look
black.  The swirls almost hypnotize you.  The path continues to the north and
west.

To the southeast is the dwarven battlefield.  The shouts of the soilders fill
your ears.  To the south is a tunnel leading out of the mines.

have fallen apart years ago.  Be careful!  The exit is just up ahead to the
west.

is rather musty smelling.  The smell just about makes you gag.  You notice some
burned out torches hanging from the wall.  They are covered in dust.  They must
not have been used in a while.
