Gatheouse~
   You are standing in an ancient, disused gatheouse.  The gates are flung
open, and from the rust on the immense hinges, you would guess that they have
been kept this way for years.  To the west is XXXX city proper, and
eastwards is a long road, leading through the center of this residential
district.

   Trade Road by Builder_5
Copyright 1993 by Curious Areas Workshop
*
The 'Trade Road' area was built as a first effort for C.A.W., and was kept
relatively simple. 'Trade Road' is a small neighborhood addition for any
standard Diku town.  It has one eastern entrance, and one western exit, and
one southern river-dock area.
'Trade Road' is small; only 52 rooms, 21 mobs, 22 objects, and 5
shops.  It consists mainly of one main road (Trade Road) with various
cross avenues and parallel streets.  Many houses/shops/ buildings have
been detailed, and plenty of room has been left for customizations and
additions.
*
This area was built to conform to the standard Diku gamma 0.0
release.  Along with all other changes you must make to change
this area to your particular db flavor,
*
edit the following rooms:
#00 -- add entrance/exit and change description to fit the outside area.
#17 -- same.
*
The east exit is at #00, the west #17.
Docks lead away on the river to the south in room #34.
Interesting areas without purpose (yet) are the:
Library (#40)
Brewery (#39)
Trading Post (#53)
Fairgrounds (not open, just south of #15 and #16).
Strange ship (not open, on docks #34).
*(IMPORTANT!)* Mob # #11 should be changed to match the standard
cityguard in the town you are attaching Trade Road to.
The descriptions for rooms #00 and #17 can be switched at will.  The
default is set up to link onto a main city through an east exit to the
west end of Trade Road.  Switching these two descriptions (don't
forget to switch the Edesc's and change east for west and vice versa
in the two descriptions!!!) 'reverses' the area, allowing a west exit
to east Trade Road.
*

A Big Thanks to Builder_5 for supporting C.A.W. Also, kudos to Tarkin
of VieMud (viemud.org 4000) for allowing us to use his mud for
pre-release testing. This area was built with the aid of George
Essl's Dikued program.  We would like to thank Mr. Essl for his time
and determination to create and support Dikued.
The following people have aided C.A.W. and Builder_5 in numerous ways,
and all receive our deepest gratitude: Shane Finkel Josh 'Champion of
Bagels' Megerman John D. Horner and the System Adminstrators of ODU

Trade Road~
   This is the west-most end of Trade Road.  Eastwards, the road continues deep
into the city, its length disguised by distance.  Just to the west, you see a
largish gatheouse in the city wall.  It seems rather quiet in the area so close
to a city gate...

Trade Road~
   This great road runs directly through the heart of XXXX.  The area seems
odd around here; the air still.  A gate marks the end of the road to the west,
and the road continues to the east.  Two shops stand across from each other
here, the north seeming more busy, the south seeming to attract a better
quality of customer.

Trade Road~
   Here Trade Road is intersected by another, smaller road.  A street sign
identifies it as 'Clay Street'.  A cursory look north and south reveals a shop
or two, but not much else of interest.  Looking west, you spy a gate in the
city wall, and Trade Road continues to the east.

Alley~
   You squeeze down this alleyway, scrunching up obscenely to pass by the
rubbish.  The alley opens up between two buildings on Trade Road southwards,
and to the north the alley continues.  There is a slight smell of decay that
teases your nose, making you feel as if it were time to move on...

   Clay Street heads north here, and intersects Trade Road to the south.  The
buildings in this area of town look fairly delapidated; this is not where
'urban renewal' happens evidently.  Westwards, a single intact stone gargoyle
marks the rubble of an ancient church.  A sad feeling akin to gloom presses
down upon your shoulders, making your own load feel that much more heavier to
bear here.

   A small straw pallet lies in the middle of this alleyway, with a few bits of

the south end of Clay Street to the east, and leads deeper in between the
buildings to the west.  A strong smell makes your eyes water; there is graffiti
on the walls, drawn with an unsteady hand and a large supply of fecal material.
A more sinister smell teases you just below the stench here just before a
breeze from the east blows it away from you.

uneasy about this area, but its probably just your imagination.

north-south running road labeled 'Staid Avenue' intersects here, taking much of
the traffic away from the main road to the south.

north side of Klelk in both directions you see some of the typical dives you
would expect close to the waterfront.  North from here Staid Avenue heads
towards Trade Road and the central areas of the city.

section of town; hence all the low-grade shops and wayhouses, not to mention
what might be called a 'tavern' to the north.

Klelk Boulevard~
   Klelk Boulevard ends here, right up against the curving city wall.  The wall
is especially high here, perhaps to protect the guards above from the rabble
below.  The wall is stained with trash and refuse, obviously missed shots at

Klelk Boulevard~
   Klelk Boulevard ends here abruptly.  It appears that there used to be more
to the east, but fresh mortarwork extends the wall right through the road.  To
the south are the city docks, extending into the swiftly flowing river.  A lone
ship sails past, travelling eastward and sporting a merchant's flag.  A ruined

   Wooden gangways and delicate rope bridges form a warren of ship and dock,
wood, water, and hemp.  The docks are small-- much too small for how many water
vessels seem to pass by this way.  One large ship is docked well away from the
other boats, an odd sigil marked on its side in the place of a name.  Its
gangway is up right now, however...  No entrance today.

Butcher's Shop~
   A somewhat unpleasant smell strikes your nose as you walk through the open
screen door of the shop.  The scent of raw meat, blood and sweat are clearly
noticable; standard for a good butchery shop.  A glass panel separates you from
a bewildering array of various slabs and shoulders of beef, deer, rabbit, and
others.  A sign hangs nearby, wooden numbers hanging from it on a large nail...

Jeweller's~
   A few strategically placed lanterns keep this shop well-lit in the absence
of any windows.  Surprisingly, there is only a plain bench with a few chairs in
the shop; you see absolutely nothing to buy at all!  As you observe, it slowly
becomes clear that this merchant's method of sale consists of having the
customer describe what they want, whereupon the merchant brings something
similar from the back through a large metal door.  This strikes you as a fairly
inefficient method of shop-keeping, but very secure.

Rubble and Ruin~
   You follow a path through the rocks and mortar to what was once the center
of the church.  A few old apple cores and a broken wooden truck tell tales of
this area being a playground for children now, but the ancient, broken
stonework around stand testament to a better age.  For a moment, your
imagination calls images forth of a dynamic pulpit and a full set of pews
around you...  Images quickly shattered by the rustle of your clothing in the
wind and a distant sound of someone talking on the street.  A sense of sadness
consumes you as you stand here, and then you turn to go.

   Barrels of beer and wine are stacked high against the walls, waiting to be

in the air, and the floorboards of the brewery are permanently stained brown
and red from spilled alcohol.  Various signs with exciting slogans are
scattered around the area, obviously for the worker's morale.  You also notice
that several barrels are open for the employees enjoyment.  The owner of this
establishment is obviously no terrible taskmaster!

however.  Looking around, you see no reason to enter the tiny rooms.  The lobby
