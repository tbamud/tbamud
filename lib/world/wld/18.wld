Nuclear Wasteland~
   Thick layers of slightly radioactive cumulus, black as iron, prevent any
light from coming through.  Heaps of fire-blackened human bones and skulls 
are scattered amid shattered concrete and fire-gutted cars.  The nuclear 
desert continues in all directions

Nuclear Wasteland~
   You walk between two toppled sky scrapers, a path leads north and 
south.  You see the remains of a playground, the outlines of playing 
children are flash-burned into the concrete.

Entrance~
   The fallen sky scrapers are closing the path to the north, but you see a open
door, partially covered by a large granite slab with some writing on it.  It is
unreadable.

Cyberdyne Building~
   A massive office lays in ruins, dozens of computers are in ruins.  Once
precisely cluttered cubicles are shredded and blocking all paths except to 
the north or south.

   You walk deeper into the complex, past broken security cameras and 
through open security doors.  Not a single sound reaches your ears.  Not 
much point on walking to the end of this building, is there?

broken and useless.  Charred human bodies still sit at the desks, the

   You work your way deeper into the complex, less and less damage is 
evident.  Except for the fact that every piece of electronic equipment is 
fried beyond repair.  A few bodies lay in the middle of the room.  Strange, 
they should have survived the blast this deep in the building.
