Nuclear Wasteland~
   You walk between two toppled sky scrapers, a path leads north and
south.  You see the remains of a playground, the outlines of playing
children are flash-burned into the concrete.

Entrance~
   The fallen sky scrapers are closing the path to the north, but you see a open
door, partially covered by a large granite slab with some writing on it.  It is
unreadable.

   A massive office lays in ruins, dozens of computers are in ruins.  Once
precisely cluttered cubicles are shredded and blocking all paths except to

   You walk deeper into the complex, past broken security cameras and
through open security doors.  Not a single sound reaches your ears.  Not
much point on walking to the end of this building, is there?

broken and useless.  Charred human bodies still sit at the desks, the
building was almost thick enough to save them.

   You work your way deeper into the complex, less and less damage is
evident.  Except for the fact that every piece of electronic equipment is
fried beyond repair.  A few bodies lay in the middle of the room.  Strange,
they should have survived the blast this deep in the building.
