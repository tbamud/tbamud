Besides, I sorta stole the idea off of a mud I played a while back.
Smurfville is an anooying place with lots of do-gooder smurfs and (of course)

the shop keeper who works behind her counter on the north wall, where her
assistants work behind a cauldron that brew some sort of noxious potion.  They
sell water here, and you wonder if it was could be tained from all the chemicals
they used in these awful potions.  The only exit out of the smell is to the
