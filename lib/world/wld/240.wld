The Southern Gate of Dun Maura~
   As you walk into the shadows between the large steel gates you realize how
insignificant you must look.  Minotaurs walk past, most several feet taller
than you.  The guards here seem to be looking for an excuse to kill something,
or someone.

   You have heard stories that minotaurs like large buildings and open spaces
which can accommodate their extended families.  They tend to get on well with
anyone displaying similar qualities to their own.  You hope they will get along

   The minotaur is one of the most powerful races.  Some growing over eight
feet tall.  Stories of minotaurs killing humans for sport abound.  But they
were all just stories, right?

   You carefully work your way along the small side street.  Trying to stay out
of the way of the minotaurs.  Their bodies are covered in a short dark fur.
Minotaurs are not considered one of the smarter races, and tend be viewed as a
race of bullies.

   You stare around in amazement at this strange race, the Minotaur.  You know
the stories well.  Generally sturdy, large and strong folk, they are mostly
hard-working, assertive and uncompromising to the point of stubbornness, which
can manifest as belligerence, boastful pride and a hot temper.

   The average Minotaur tends to wear very little clothing because their fur
provides quite a bit of warmth.  They trample past you with a certain
determination that makes you feel uneasy.  They all look so...  Confident.

race because of how they value strength.  This makes them very seclusive.
