The Western Campus Entrance~
   This gateway is made of limestone, and covered in ivy.  Beyond the entrance,
the university stretches as far as the eye can see.  A sign is neatly posted on
the left pillar of the gateway.  It is made of nicely polished brass.  Because
of this, it looks rather important (as all signs go).

Copyright 1994 by Curious Areas Workshop
Campus is a large tongue-in-cheek area loosely based on a Canadian
university campus.  Below is a step by step guide that should work
for most DikuMuds...
The campus consists of 232 rooms.
  #00 (exit west to the rest of the world)
  #22 (exit north to the rest of the world)
  #86 (add a PEACEFUL flag if you have one)
Edit the following objects:
  #46 (make the edesc appear as your login screen.)
  #59
*
The mobs in this area were built on a -100 (good) to 100 (bad) armor
class range.  Remove the extra '0' if you don't need/want it.
*
Here are some recommended specials for the mobs:
  #04 should be given a sleep spell to cast
  #47 should be given an undead process.

want to be.  Exits lead in all cardinal directions.  A footnote has been

   This nice and inviting building does not seem quite so nice and inviting

The Post Office~
   This seems to be the standard post office given to any university by the
wonderful XXX government.  You can tell that it is a university post office
because of the surplus amount of obscene graffiti upon the walls.  The back
hall is south of here.

De-Tox Unit~
   This room seems to be the place where people get "detoxified".  Although it
smells pretty bad, it wouldn't be a bad idea to remember where this is so that
you can rest here later.  You find it rather difficult to manoeuvre in here
because of the large number of drunks on the floor.  The only exit is north.

Ellis Hall Lobby~
   This large room seems to serve as a display area for neat engineering
devices and awards.  There are four exits.  The east exit will take you out
towards the street whilst the north and west exits are too dark to see the ends
of.  The stairs on the south side of the room lead up to the second floor and
whatever might be up there...
