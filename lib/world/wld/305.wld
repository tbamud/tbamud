The Stone Door~
   You find yourself standing in a dry circular room which is illuminated by a
small brass torch set in the wall.  Flickering shadows dance about the room in
a manner you find disorienting.  Beneath the torch is an elaborate mahogany
door, complete with a small silver doorknob.

Written March 1994
This area is kinda weird, It started as an addendum to
Moria and then went off in its own direction. *shrug*

Enclosed is an area I wrote back in my mudding days; they
are designed for circle code, but with some modifications can probably
be integrated into whatever kind of mud you're running.

These areas are FREE- however, if you use them:
1. Feel free to make whatever modifications you need, change mobs,
objects, room descriptions etc.- but please make sure that signs and author
references are unmodified and readable by players.
2. Please send me an e-mail message if you do use them, I'd just
like to have some idea of where they end up (please include mud site)- my
address is wjp@@hopper.unh.edu until Sept 1996
3. If you redistribute these areas, please make sure this README
file goes with them :)

The Smooth Tunnel~
   Looking down at your feet, you are somewhat surprised to find that you are
walking on a thick woven rug.  The walls of the tunnel that you are in are
completely smooth, and polished to a gleam.  Before you, the tunnel opens up to
what appears to be a small chamber.

The Furnished Chamber~
   This chamber is furnished quite nicely, with a thick woven rug beneath your
feet, and tapestries along the walls.  There is a rectangular hole in the rug,
revealing a trapdoor which seems to open via a small iron ring, The room's exit
looms behind you.

The Stone Staircase~
   You find yourself in a rough stone staircase, which winds around a smooth
core of stone, descending deeper into the bowels of the earth.  Small torches
are set into the stone, guiding your way.

Down..Down..Down..~
   Your descent picks up speed, and you trip over an unseen obstacle in the
stairway!  As you tumble, the stairs start to become narrower and then begin to
slope forward.  You soon find yourself sliding in circles down the tunnel,
which has now become smooth stone, covered with very fine sand.  You faintly
detect the sound of delighted laughter echoing in some faraway place.

The Slide~
   You come out of the last spin, and are abruptly deposited on a slide made of
some slick metal.  You descend rapidy, being abruptly slammed against the walls
as the slide banks through several tight corners.  Ahead of you, approaching
rapidly is a small point of light.

The Ledge~
   You pop out of the slide, sail through the air for several long moments,
crash into the side of a cavern, and land on a ledge in a crumpled heap.  You
slowly look upwards, and what you see astounds even you- a seasoned adventurer.
You are in the north end of a perfectly square cavern with a floor composed of
sixty-four alternating black and white marble tiles.  Giant torches line the
walls, casting a dazzling glow over the entire room.  Standing guard over half
the squares are giant carved wooden beings, looming and silent.  There is a
neat wooden ladder beneath you, leading downward, and three quarters up the
opposite wall is the small hole you just came flying out of.

   You are on a simple wooden ladder, which has been bolted by means of small
metal hooks to the cavern wall.  The ledge is above you, and the cavern floor
is below you.  There is a small sign on the wall.

   You are in a small chamber, containing only a bed, basin, mirror and braided
rug.  Despite being very small, it looks comfortable enough to rest in for a
bit.  As you seat yourself on the bed, you see a flicker of motion in the
mirror..

with a cackle.  The image abruptly fades...

The Landing~
   You drop down from the trap-door, and land on soft dirt.  You seem to be

There is a small wooden dock extending from your enclave out into the river.

The Dock~
   As you step onto the dock, it sags crazily and settles more firmly into the
river.  A sudden bright light shines out from upriver, blinding you
momentarily.  The light approaches closer, and you realize that it is some
strange form of boat.  It stops at the north side of the dock, ready to be
boarded.

The Sulking Swan~
   The sulking swan is a large wooden craft, carved to the exact likeness of a
swan.  Its wooden sides thump hollowly against the tunnel sides, as it bobs
gently and begins to carry you downstream.

Arrival~
   The Sulking Swan heads directly to its berth, lining up alongside the wooden
platform.  Ropes move of their own accord, rising from the pilings and
intertwining themselves with the boat's brass brackets.  It seems safe to step
east onto the second dock, or you could just sit here and keep the boat
company.

The Second Dock~
   You decide that this dock is much sturdier than the first, and it feels
quite nice to stand on firm ground again.  The boat is tied to the west, and a
nice red wooden door waits expectantly at the east end of the dock- it seems to
lead directly into the tunnel wall.
