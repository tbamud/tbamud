The Castle of Desire - Honeybear~
   The Castle Of Desire - Zone.  Hello, This zone is somewhere in between the
Newbie Zone and the Chessboard of Midgarrd in difficulty.  In fact the
charactersitics of most of the mobiles was cloned from these.  Due to the
"adult/ sexually oriented nature" of some of the objects.  This zone as it
stands would be oriented toward an adult user base.  However it would be easily
modified to change those few items which some people might find offensive.  
The Zone was created as a replica of our talker - The Castle of Desire.  
Please visit us by coming to our Home Page at: http://www.  Bcl.  Net/desire
New Players are always welcome and I'm happy to help talker and mud
administrators all i can.  You can reach me on my talker or in my mud or email
me at: brussell@@specent.  Com.  Have fun and good luck.  Bill (Honeybear)

Great Hall~
   This large Public Scening Hall is a cavernous room with a vaulted ceiling
upon which a fresco depicts angels, cherubs and robed figures in postures of
ecstacy as they dispense or receive pleasure.  A blazing fireplace at one end
of the room is flanked by chairs in which slaves writhe in pleasure, impaled on
their masters' laps.  In the centre of the room is a pole to which slaves may
be tethered as they submit to exquisite punishment.  A basket holding riding
crops, whips, switches and paddles is near at hand.  At the far end of the room
is a bed-sized platform between two tall columns.  On the platform, a slave is
lying on her back, her arms chained to rings set in the columns.  Her legs are
bent back and suspended in midair by a chain fastened to a hook in the ceiling,
awaiting her Master.

Corridor~
   You have entered a dark corridor that is dimly lit with candles...  There
are old paintings of past Kings, Queens, and Royalty lining the walls...  
Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, drapping around you.  You peer down the corridor
and see a small door to what you think might be the servants quarters..  You
wonder if you should take a closer look to see where it leads..

Master~
   You smell faint traces of sandal wood and leather, and the fragrence of oils
and a touch of honey as you enter the Masters chamber.  The room is dominated
by a huge, heavy, mahogony bed...  Covered in black satin covers.  In front of
a large stone fireplace are two overstuffed leather chairs, inviting you for a
brief period of contemplation..  Perhaps you sip a brandy from the well stocked
bar, or gaze on the shelves on the wall containing all the gadgets and toys
that a true Master and gentlman might need to entertain himself with a willing
companion or Sub...  Whom you may see the shadow of her figure lurking in the
shadows...  Waiting on her Master

Servant's Quarters~
   Here in this room you see a very humble abode.  A simple place where the
servants live having only the necessities of life.  There are rows of simple
cots with thin bedding and blankets, little privacy for any who share this
place.  Some have draped old moth eaten blankets between thier cots for some
semblence of a place of privacy.  There is little time spent her for the
servents..  Only for a few limited hours of sleep before they are called on for
thier duties to be performed for the Master and Mistress of the Castle.

Catacombs~
   Walking among the catacombs is quite disorienting.  One dark corridor looks
like another : dry and dusty.  You would become forever lost should your torch
falter.  The darkness could possibly be the deadliest thing down here.  The
catacombs are rumored to lead to many things, including the Wizard's den.  You
chuckle at the thought of following the echos of incantations bouncing from
hall to hall.  You also deduce that the lowest part of the stle's domain must
hold the dungeon.  Perhaps you should keep the draft in your face so as you do
not accidentally wander into the dungeon.  Who knows what wanders in that area.
If you are lucky you might be able to find a exit leading to one of the
Castle's rooms.

Dungeon~
   The atmosphere of this enormous stone-vaulted underground chamber is dark
and oppressive.  Manacles dangle from iron rings set deeply in the stone walls.
A pair of leather ankle restraints is fastened to the end of a chain which is
looped over a pulley set in an oak beam in the ceiling of the dungeon.  
Through the bars of a dark cell in the corner, you see the form of a softly
sobbing slave.  The pillory in the center of the dungeon is occupied by a slave
her e she is bound, bruised and swollen waits as her master left her.

Royalty~
   You have descended into an intimate amphitheatre of abandon where
exhibitionists and voyeurs are welcome (and encouraged) to play.  Far above
you, a large crack in the domed ceiling reveals a myriad of dark
constellations.  The morning star winks mischieveously on the horizon.  A low
stage, covered with soft, luxurious cushions, is surrounded by a reviewing
stand rising above it on all sides.  The stands are padded and cozy, allowing
watchers to lounge or indulge themselves in the shadows.  The stage is
surrounded by soft, low candlelights, the players move slow to the music.  Two
large thrones sit at the front of the stage for the King and his Queen to view
the scenes.

Bedroom~
   This cozy bedroom is tucked away from prying eyes; small, yet wonderful in
its capacity.  Dimmed lighting set into the floors gives your eyes just enough
to move around by, as you notice the enormous king-sized bed taking up much of
floor space.  Complete with black satin sheets, you and your lover rest
comfortably on its surface, the water-filled mattress relaxing you.  The
mellifluous sound of breakers rumbling and crashing against the shore seeps
from hidden speakers, you and your lover's chests rising and falling in sync.
A pair of elegant black orchids rest in an onyx vase upon the small night table
next to you.  From all around, a dozen airy voices whisper, "Set me afire with
your touch, my love, and quench me with your kiss ...  "

one side of the dark sky to the other.  You finally close your eyes with
happiness and excitement.  Knowing that you have just seen a shooting star, you
begin to make a wish...  The next morning you wake up and find yourself at the
same spot as you were the night before and figured you must have drifted off to
sleep....  But as you start to get up, you see something different, something
strange, something new...  You noticed that your wish come true...

   The moon has turned a translucent silver and casts a light that illuminates
the outlines of the bodies in the hot tub.  This is the place to relax and get
to know the one sitting across from you.  The hot tub is cozy, almost magical
as the pulsing jet stream of water makes direct contact in your most secret
places and those strong, smooth bubbles massage reality away.  Soft music, with
a steady beat fills the air, touches your soul and strikes an almost primal
urge in you.  You drift in a secure and sensual place as your body responds to
the steamy water, the feather-light touches of someone and you enter a
dreamlike state.

on the side.  The west is also adorned, not with bookcases, but with my coat of
arms, and my fabulous sword collection.  The south, where you entered, has a
door leading to the spirial staircase that lead you to the tower.  In the
center of the room, there is a round table with 6 chairs around it, in the
center of the table, there are fresh roses in a vase.  As you enter, I look up
from my desk in the northwestern part of the tower, put down my quill pen, and
properly greet you into the tower.

you see only darkness...  There is no light..  It is as though you are hanging
in limbo you can not touch nor feel anything around you including the floor if
there is one...  You can not go forward nor can you retrace your steps in...  
And you hear the anguish of other souls as they linger here...  You are
alone...  You are lost...  All you feel is desperation..  There is no where
else you can go...  You poor lost soul.......

Death~
   You suddenly find yourself seemingly floating through a white void.  There
is a hint of landscape, almost tangible like a cloud, yet seemingly no more
real than a dream.  Where are you?  In your dazed state you conclude you have a
choice of going in one of two directions.  Which will it be?  In one direction
you see brightness and feel warmth, from the other direction there is darkness
but a burning heat, and sounds of anguish.  You can not speak here or .tell or
.shout you are in a limbo state untill a wiz or higher talks to you..  You must
decide if you are willing to cooperate and behave here.....  Smiles then you
will be freed.  YOU ARE DEAD!

as She.  To her I pledge my undying love and affection for as long as she
chooses to light my way!

The Castle Moat~
   As you go down into the Castle Moat you are pleasantly surprised that you
can swim.  The water is cold and muky with all manners of yuky stuff floating
about.  Could be trash dumped from the windows of the Castle by the staff or,
could be parts of bodies of those who have dared attack the Castle.  The Moat
continues East and West accross the front and sides of the Castle.  You can
also go down if you can hold your breath and arent afraid of deep dark cold
places.  A slippery ladder leads back up to the Foyer!

The Eastern Side of the Moat~
   As you continue swimming you finally come to a solid wall which signals the
end of this side of the moat.  Your only choice is to go back from where you
came.

Under Water in the Moat~
   You are under the water in the Moat.  Its very dark and you almost choke
from the muck that surrounds you.  You have a feeling you should go back from
where you came.  If you go down futher you will surely die!

The Deadly Depths of the Moat~
   The pressure is too much for you to handle.  You better go up before you
drown.
