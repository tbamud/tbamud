Breakwaters of McGintey Bay~
   The water of the bay and the water from the Yllythad meet each other in
protesting currents, making the water here a constant roil of unpredictable
motion.  Sailors that move past this area do so in a hurried manner, making sure
that their ships are not dashed against the cliff face the encloses the bay.

   The cove walls come to a last curve before opening up into the waters of the
Yllythad.  McGintey Cove lies to the north, its walls high above the sea on
McGintey Rock, the dock area at sea level, allowing sailors to load and unload
their cargo.

Nearing the Docks of McGintey~
   The docks of McGintey lie just north of here, a bustle of sea travel all
around as ships nudge their way in past each other in an attempt to get to dock
first.  The waters are much less in the grip of the sea's current here, no pull
or tug can be felt from the waters.  Only the occasional swell from a passing
ship.

around as ships nudge their way in past each other in an attempt to get to dock
first.  The water here is much more calm than that to the south which is closer
to the open sea.  The current here does not pull and tug quite so much.

   The water here is still deep, but much more calm as it reaches closer to the
docks of the city.  The steep rock walls of McGintey Rock rises on the east
side, the Rock being the foundation which McGintey Cove rests upon.

   The water is quite calm here, as it laps gently against the rock face of
McGintey Rock, the rock which the seaport city of McGintey rests upon.  The
docks of the city lie to the east, full of ships and people.

   The calm, still waters of the Bay are only broken when a ship comes or goes
from the docks to the east.  Most of the ships docked along this area appear to
be cargo haulers, the type to carry large amounts of goods over long distances.

The End of Dock 1~
   If it is possible, the hustle and bustle of this dock seems even more
pronounced here at the end.  The workers seem almost frantic to unload the ships
which seem to come and go in nonstop motion from the Bay.

   The water is constantly being churned about by rowers and ships' rudders as
they negotiate their way into the docks on either side.  Off to the south,
beyond the dock area is the Bay and beyond that the huge expanse of the Yllythad
Sea, its broad borders some say might never be charted by man.

   Ships move their way in and out of docking unceasingly, shipping passengers

captains curse and dockmen grunt and sweat their way through just another day on
the docks.

   The folk at the end of the dock who are not workers for one of the many
travel agencies recline lazily in brightly painted benches or tap their feet
impatiently while waiting for their ship to arrive.  It seems the travel
industry booms mightily in McGintey!

Dock Area~
   This section of the dock area is relatively quiet, as quiet as an dock area
can be, anyway.  The boats here are not near as large as the ones docked off to
the east, most of the ones here belonging to individual owners who pay a rent to
keep their boats here.

   The quiet rocking of the boats docked here and the occasional bump of a
ships side against the padded sides of the docks are all that can be heard from
this dock.  The men and women who walk along it share a mutual respect for the
others who use it, as most are private owners of sea craft that get docked here
by paying a rental fee.  Loud raucous noise can be heard almost in a quiet roar
from the west where the commercial boating companies ply their trade.

   The commercial docks of McGintey loom above, the business docks to the west

against the framework of the docks allowing access to the top of the docks.
The smell here is something beyond awful, the layers of goo and grime in the
water so close to the city almost untolerable.

   This dock is almost as confused as the people who walk upon it.  The west
side, used for the loading and unloading of precious cargos from around the
world, is a bustle of frantic activity and motion.  The east side, used to dock
the commercial sea crafts of the travel agencies in McGintey, is a serene,
comfortable area where travelers stroll along nonchalantly, boarding their craft
leisurely as most of them are on vacation.

large city's docks is gone, replaced by a pine scented clean smell that is
applied hourly.  The docks themselves are painted with and green to compliment
the color of the sea.

and women who work along it all dressed in finery and ready to tend to any
customer's whim.
