Entering the sewers~
   As you descend into this stinking, mud-filled swamp, at the very bottom of
the city, you can't help noticing how much waste, so many people create.  And
it's all here under your feet - and in your boots!  You see water filled with
all kinds of bad things coming from east and west, drifting north from here.

Under the Drainpipe~
   You are standing at the end of a huge drainpipe, which leads upward in a
gentle slope, a gentle stream of sewage slowly runs north, deeper into what must
be the sewers of what ever city is at the end of that pipe.  Few options present
themselves to you in this mess, knee deep in sewage you have but two choices,
either venture north and deeper in to the sewers, and meet what ever creatures
might dwell in this filthy place, or attempt to go up through that pipe, with a
chance of getting out of this dark and gloomy place.

Pipe turning north and west~
   You are in a pipe, leading north and west.  The pipe is big enough for you to
stand upright, and just dry enough at this point to be able to walk without
getting your feet wet.  Still, sewage is trickling through the pipe and you come
to the conclusion, that you're happy you chose to come here in the dry season.

A pipe deep underground.~
   You are walking through a larger than man-sized pipe, in the capitals sewers.
From the north you hear some scratching and the sound of small animals.  You've
seen rat tracks earlier, and they were a bit too large for your taste.

A pipe deep underground~
   The sounds of rats can no longer be ignored.  The big pipe has recent
markings of claws and fangs.  It is clear, that whatever lives here is too big
to be ordinary rats.  North of here you can barely make out a crossing, and
south the pipe continues.

A three-way intersection~
   You are standing in what was once a north/east turn in the pipe.  To the
west, however, there is a large hole in the pipe which makes it possible to go
that way too.  As you examine the hole, you notice that it's not man-made.
Some quite large, toothmarks along the perimeter suggest it was done by some of
the rodents inhabiting the sewers.  The sound of rats moving about is strong
from both the east and the west.

A bend in the tunnel~
   The pipe turns north and west.  To the north there is a grating which blocks
the pipe.  It seems noone has been down here for ages to clean the grate, so it
is stuck in it's current position.  It's hopeless getting past it.  Behind it
you hear the sound of animals.  Again you think of rats, but they sound so BIG!.

   You are on the north side of a very mucky grate, and around you are every
evidence of absence of people you'll ever need - knee-high muck, green slime
dropping from the walls, a profound smell of rats, fungus growing on the
ceiling.  You feel very dirty just being here.  Also you can't help hearing lots
of noises from the north-west.  Sounds like something's having a feast.

around your ankles you feel the water flowing towards it.  The fungus on the
walls are luminous, so you have every chance to study the dirty ceiling, the
green slime, and the big rats.  From the west you hear the sounds of big
creatures eating - or is it many small?

The northern drainhole~
   You are in a domed room with a drainhole in the middle.  Originally this room
was intended as the end of the pipe from the east, but it seems that the rats
disagree.  They have made a nest south of here, and a tunnel to the west.  The
room is very dirty and you deduct that no civil servant would ever go all the
way inhere, even if it was originally so intended.  The ceiling is overgrown
with luminous fungus, making the room bright as day.  You can hear the sounds of
creatures eating, bones being crushed.  The source seems to be south of here.

A dirt tunnel~
   This low tunnel has been dug by many claws, making the walls if not smooth,
then at least soft to the touch, and you do not feel very safe here.  You are
worried if the tunnel can take a full grown person, crawling as you are.  East
of here you see a domed chamber, nothing like the dirt you're crawling in, but
south you just see more and more of it.  You are also aware of a loud sound from
your east - almost like chewing.

   As far as you can see live couldn't get much worse - You're crawling through
dirt on your hands and knees with no obvious relief within eyesight.  Around you
the markings of claws suggest large amounts of rats of dog-like proportions in
your immediate vicinity.  And to top that off, you are hearing strange sounds
from the north.

A dirt tunnel~
   This tunnel is not very big.  You can only fit in, if you crawl on your hands
and knees, making it hard for you to get an overview of the situation.
However, you have no doubt that the tunnel leads somewhere, as it's obviously
being used often, judging from the marks on the walls.  You can crawl on north,
or make your way to the intersection to the east.

The Lair of the King Rat.~
   You are in a cave, dug in the wall.  In the far corner a lot of debris is
huddled up, in the makings of a nest, while closer to the exit, a mound of old
bones make out a trash pile.  Or at least that's your guess - hard to tell
exactly, actually.  The room is the lair of a gigantic rat, bigger than the rest
of them, which seems to have at least some intelligence.  Glittering objects,
reflecting the dim light from the luminous fungus, litter the nest.  It seems
the Rat King has gathered what others has dropped.

the floor of the room.  Muck is dripping over the edge, and the smell is
horrible.  As you go closer to the edge and take a peek, you realize there is a
drop of about 20', before the bottom is reached.  Not caring to try if you can
climb down, you also notice a ladder carved into the wall of the hole.  As you
examine the hole closer you see a grate further down.

This chamber in itself is but a mere junction of pipes.  Stinking water comes
drifting from the west and north, flowing out to your east.  The smell inhere is
torture to your nose, but luckily you are starting to get used to it.

as your light lets you see.

small holes in it.  Through the small holes you see a lot of bats.  It seems the
grating was put here for a reason.

   You immediately notice the change in smell.  Guano.  The bats have seized
this part of the sewers for themselves.  Obviously the grate to your south is
there to stop the bats from infecting the whole sewer system.  You can see the
pipe through it.  You can also enter the bats' territory by going west or north.

   You're in a large domed room.  You realized this was once where the builders
of the sewers lived and had their things stored.  This makes it easier to
understand the fresh air you're smelling from the north.  It also helps explain
the millions of bats you see on the ceiling, ignoring you totally.  You can
continue north through a jagged opening, and south to the pipes.

foot.  Through the hole bats are swarming in and out.  As far as you can tell
going up would take you out of the capital.  You can also go south to a large
chamber.

while others merely cling to the ceiling as you pass.  You come to think of the

runs down your spine.  You can leave this side tunnel to your east, and it

A strange halt~
   The tunnel comes abruptly to an end.  The room you're standing in has not
been formed by humanoid hands.  It is a work of nature, carved by running water.
Obviously the persons digging the sewers suddenly opened up to this chamber and
found no way of closing again.  On the eastern wall clear water is running from
a natural cavern of some sort, through a hole too small to fit in, and most of
the water then continues to the east of here through a larger hole.  To your
south however, a metal door, with a heavy padlock blocks your passage.  Through
some bars in the door you see still water, and a moored boat.  Some of the water
also runs through the pipe to your north, creating a natural flow.

however long you would hold your breath, that hole would most definitely kill
you by sheer pressure from the water.  Also you notice several chests obviously
hidden by someone who thought this a safe place.  You can't fight the water
without risking to fall into the hole, so you can only get out through a little
hole high up on the eastern wall.

Outside the cave~
   You are standing outside a gloomy cave, from which an occasional bat flies
out around you.  You may enter the cave by going south, but can head back toward
the city by going west from here.

Outside the capital~
   Who would have thought the world could be so barren just outside the capital
itself.  You're standing in some low foothils near some rocky ground to your
east.  South of here a gravelled path leads towards the western highway.

On a gravelled path~
   You are walking along a gravelled path.  North of here the gravel path
continues, while to the south you enter the bustle of the western highway.
