Detta's [Dollhouse] Description Room~
   @BTheme:@n This zone is a little abstract, more a sort of Alice-in-Wonderland
 experience that revolves around a strange dollhouse in
an antique shop. The idea is to get out once you're in, which basically entails
completing the quest... a series of mini-quests.
Note that to get any sense of this zone, you pretty much need to start in
the room down from here, and nohassle needs to be off. ;)
   @GPlayers:@n Mainly for players around level 10-ish, this zone is primarily
neutral with a couple evil places and a couple good ones. Its been designed as
mostly a puzzle-solving, quest area, but opportunity for xp to be gained as
well, as each completed quest gives 10,000 xp.
   @RLocation:@n The only concrete location in the zone is the beginning
room which is a London street leading into an antiques shop.
   @MSecrets:@n There are now absolutely loads up :), just type LOOK SPOILERS
to see them, but you'll have more fun here if you don't ;).
   @CNote:@n If you have any suggestions, spot any typos, bugs, or
weirdnesses, please mudmail me - Detta. :-) All input appreciated!
You can also email me at detta@@builderacademy.net
East takes you through the other zones I have built here.
Down takes you to the starting room of this zone.

   In room 11859 you can find the angry girl.  She will attack you instantly
when you walk in and the key to completing this quest is to let her tire herself
out attacking you while keeping both her and yourself alive.  Once you let her
wear herself out she will apologize and ask for a hug, give it to her and she
will suddenly be a lot more receptive to writing in the journal.

12~
   In room 11844 is the emaciated girl, mumbling away absent-mindedly to
herself.  To trigger this quest, as with almost all the others; just give her
the journal.  She will give a little speech about sacrifice before asking you to
make the ultimate one, and handing you a hotdog.  Now, not being any ordinary
hotdog, eating it will take a huge chunk out of your hps.  If it doesn't kill
you she will hand you another one, reminding you that the sacrifice is death.
Once you have eaten enough of them to render you incapacitated, she will heal
you and explain that it was your willingness to make the sacrifice that she
wanted.  Giving her the journal at any time after this point will cause her to
write in it for you.

   If you enter room 11870 (The Bunkbed Room) you will hear a child's voice
telling you to "crawl in here".  The command crawl will cause you to crawl under
the bed and enter room 11871 where the hiding girl is.  Giving her the journal
will make her ask you for three things...  Three corpses in particular.
The corpse of a fish (the red trout - mobvnum: 11830, objvnum: 11856)
The corpse of a bird (the taildove - mobvnum: 11831, objvnum: 11857)
The corpse of a toad (the vile toad - mobvnum: 11832, objvnum: 11858)
Once you have brought her all three of those things she will apologize and ask
for one further thing... a secret that Ridley guards.
If you go to Ridley and ask her a question with the word secret in it she will
consent to give it to you.
Once you have this item, just return to the hiding girl, give it to her and
she will offer to write in the journal for you... give it to her and the job
is done.

   The weeping girl is found in room 11864.  As with all of the quests, giving
her the journal is what triggers it.  She will explain that she is upset because
she can no longer spend time in her garden because of the monster there.  The
quest then is to find is search out the garden west of the porch (room 11846)
until you see a hideous looking creature.  Kill it, return to the weeping girl
and give her the journal, and she will write in it for you.  As a side note,
examining the mirror in the room with her will give you some dynamic information
on your character ;)
~
E
08~
   The blind girl can be found in room 11854.  Giving her the journal triggers
her giving you a pair of eyes and telling you to examine the walls.  All you
have to do is wear the eyes, examine the walls as she says, and say aloud the
word you see written there.  If its correct she'll agree to write in the
journal.
~
E
07~
   The running girl can be found running up and down inside the tunnel in room
11831.  She moves fast, so the only way to really interact with her is to follow
her..  Which will take you on a bit of a spammy ride.  As soon as you give her
the journal however, she will come to a halt and tell you that all she wants is
to be taken out of there.  She agrees to write in it if you will show her the
way out and agrees to do whatever you say.  The key here is that she does just
that, whatever you speak she does...  So if you say north, she moves north etc.
All you have to do is lead her with speech to the vortex and through it.  Once
on the other side she will happily write in the journal when you give it to her.
~
E
05~
   Ridley can be found playing with alphabet blocks in room 11836.  If you give
her the journal she'll launch into a little speech and finally decide to write
in it if you bring her three things.  She'll give you a black box and ask for a
fruit, a flower, and a flying thing, and for you to return them in the box.
The fruit is obj 11828 and loads in room 11837.
The flower is obj 11832 and loads in room 11831.
And the flying thing is a little mob (11821) that basically wanders all over.
The trick to giving her this thing is to type CAPTURE INSECT in the same room as
it. This will then let you put it in the box with the rest of the things.
Once all three things are in the box, just give it to her, and she'll write in
the journal as well as giving you a sword that you'll need for later. ;)
Oh, the insect will escape from you after a while, so make sure to put it in the box if you don't want to lose it.

   The coloring child is super easy to deal with, she is in room 11809 and just
wants a red crayon.  Give her the journal as always to trigger the quest, then
find the red crayon in room 11812 (where the playing child is).  Once you give
her the crayon she'll accept the journal and write in it.
~
E
03~
   The playing child can be found in room 11812 (Their Room), once you give her
the journal she will hand it back and tell you she wants you to release the bird
kept in the house.  She'll also give you a key (referred to as Pin) so that you
can unlock the cage.  You'll find the bird inside a cage in room 11818, just
unlock the cage and take the bird out to release it.  Then the playing child
will write in the journal when you give it to her.  Additionally, the key she
gave you will open the door that The Way to the Middle leads to from The
Crossroads.

   Okay, this is basically the main point of the zone.  When you are teleported
by the dollshouse you find yourself in a room with a girl who gives you an eye.
If you OPEN EYE you will continue with the quest, CLOSE EYE to hightail it out
of there.  For those who continue on, they will be teleported to a crossroads
and given a journal.  The basic idea behind the journal is that its empty when
you start off, the only way to get it filled is to give it to the various mobs
you find, and complete their mini quests to get them to write in it.  The goal
is to find all those mobs, get them all to write in it, and complete the
journal.  :)
~
E
01~
   Once you enter the Antique shop, the saleswoman should greet you.  The main
item to look out for here is of course the dollshouse ;).  Looking at it or
examining it should trigger some prompts from the saleswoman as to the doll that
came with it.  Removing the doll from the dollshouse will cause you to be
teleported, essentially triggering your quest within the zone.

   The tunnel-man can be found in room 11831, once you give him the journal he
asks you to enter the tunnel and destroy some of the secrets there.  Typing
ENTER will put you through the vortex and into another area where secrets are
roaming wildly in the form of dark figures.  Once you've killed fifteen of them,
the tunnel-man will accept the journal and write in it.  He'll also tell you of
how many you've killed if you hand the journal to him before you've killed all
fifteen.

   The fidgety girl hangs out in room 11863 and is a pretty unstable character.
Once you give her the journal she'll ask you to play a game with her...  If you
win three times she'll write in the book for you.  The bad part?  Every time you
lose she slashes her arm with frustration, if she does that three times without
healing she'll die.  Its a simple cup and ball game though, so hopefully not too
difficult..  She just puts the ball under a random cup, and then randomly mixes
them around.  If you pick the right cup you win.  She keeps track of your score
and once you have won three times (it does not have to be concurrently), just
give her the journal again.
~
E
13~
   The silent girl can be found in room 11852, and is silent for one major
reason - her lips have been stitched together.  She will indicate this when you
give her the journal, hopefully providing the hint that she wants something done
about it.  Examining her will offer the idea that you have to cut them, and with
no ordinary sword.  The sword you need is the sword of words (obj 11835), which
Ridley gives you upon completion of her quest.  If you have it, just type cut,
and the stitching will weaken enough to allow her to speak, and agree to write
in the journal.
~
E

   The scarred child hangs out in room 11872 (Inside the Gazebo), giving her the
journal will launch her into a speech about her own lost story.  Choked by the
pines she says it is, and the only way to get it back is to burn them down and
recover the pages from the ashes.  With this task set, she gives you a
flickering candle and asks you to return all the pages to her.  There are five
pines throughout the zone and all must be burned down to retrieve the right
amount of pages.  In rooms (11850, 11849, 11848, 11820, 11837) is where they can
all be found.  As long as you have the candle somewhere on your person, typing
BURN PINES will set the trees on fire.  They will burn for about three minutes
before leaving nothing but a black page.  Return all five pages to the girl and
she will offer to write in the journal.  Once this is done, she will also give
you the completed book and ask you to return it to the house somewhere, just as
a favor to her.
~
E
16~
   The ghostly girl can be found in room 11848 and is the last mob that must be
approached.  If you approach her before completing every one of the other quests
she will remind you of this.  If they are already completed and you give her the
journal she will make the request that you kill her and bury the corpse in the
room.  Once you do this, her invisible spirit will complete the last entry in
the journal for you, and you will be returned to the antique shop where the
entire quest started.
~
E
17~
   Once you are returned to the antique shop, a young woman will approach you
with an interest in the journal.  If you give it to her she will exchange it for
a fiery bloodstone amulet.  This amulet has the power to move you to a safe
place whenever you use it.  This can however, only be used about once every 20
minutes, as the amulet needs to recharge itself.

A Dimly-lit Room~
   An all but silent, featureless room curves gently around in an oddly oval
shape.  Smooth walls glow faintly, a gentle light pulsing from the polished
white floor.  Vague muffled noises can be heard from very far away, the border
of the room shimmering transparantly now and again and allowing glimpses of
other places.  There are no windows, no doors or exits, but then it seems that
not much here actually exists at all.

   The smell of time and decay lingers heavy in the air, along with the various
sparkling particles of dust.  Cobwebs flutter in the darker corners of the

old and forgotten items lie cluttered around the place, even the shop counter is
cracked and sagging beyond repair.

A Massive Garden~
   A rusty toolshed stands here, blocked up with various pieces of equipment and
broken bicycles.  The grasses too seem stained with the color of bleeding
metal, the copper color making the place seem even more dry and desert-like.

A Massive Garden~
   Young trees are just beginning to flourish here, frail branches waving
uncertainly in the air, tiny seedlings and leaves wafting dreamily about.  The
hard ground is slightly cracked, blistering with dryness benath the thick matted
carpet of dead and dying grass.

By the Gazebo~
   A beautiful wooden gazebo stands to the south, a large house standing further
off to the east surrounded by flat brown grasses.  Few flowers grow here, only
scattered weeds and a few dark shrubs, most of the land too dry to support much
growth.

In the Basement~
   Cool white walls enclose this room, grayed with the markings of children's
handprints and smudged crayon colors.  Thin gray carpeting covers this whole
open area, the large room extending off to the north and to the east.  Pieces of
food have scattered down from the stairs to the south, sticky black masses of
unidentifiable substance staining the floor.

   The floor here is hard and unfinished, the jagged surface flickering with
dark shadows from the furnace flame that dances here.  Smooth metal panelling
contains the fire, a small grid allowing the light and heat to fill the room,
large pipes carrying the warmth to the rest of the house.

some other disgusting scent, metallic and nauseating.

A Girl's Bedroom~
   Cement walls have been painted white here, although the paint looks almost as
if it has been rubbed away in places, leaving the cold stone-gray surface bare.
Shelving along the walls hold various little stuffed animals and toys, as well
as a plastic radio that crackles as it plays some old, worn tape of panpipe
music.  A window on the western wall lets in a cool draft, wafting away a strong
ammonia and chlorine smell, and a subtler metallic one.  The carpet is light in
places, contrasting noticeably with the darker patches of dirt as if it had been
bleached in areas, and a streak of bloodied fingerprints smears the eastern
wall.

   This roughly made bedroom is actually part of the larger, open basement.  A
crude structure of wood panelling and hanging blankets separates the small
square-ish area from the rest of the room, allowing for some privacy and seclusion
although no doors or solid walls seal it off.  A television set flickers dimly
in the shadows, unwatched but left to buzz continually, as if there was a need
to fill the place with constant noise.

area for children, a few cushions lie strewn about, as well as several well-used
children's books, and an old television set buzzes quietly to itself.

the occasional flicker of a creeping insect running across the floor, and the

splotches or perhaps more disturbingly, smudged letters and words.  The

if some glowing paintball gun had been liberally used to decorate the place.
