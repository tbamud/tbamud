The Entrance To The Shadow Grove~
   Before you, the grove of shadows lies.  Giant gray trees are all that
can be seen through the thick shadows.  A great sense of both power and
menace permeates the surrounding area.  You have a strange urge to turn
back and go back the way you've come.
   A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the plains.

underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there.  It is almost as if the

oblivious to your presence.

   Opposite the oven is an equally enormous meat locker, large enough
to comfortably store several hapless adventurers no doubt.  In the middle
of the room, hanging in mid-air is a spice rack.
