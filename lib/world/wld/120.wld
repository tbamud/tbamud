blocking your way and judging by the amount of rust and foliage growing on the

   This is a busy paved road that runs north through the city.  The people
of Rome are very friendly and say hello as you pass.  A gate leading out of
the city lies to the south and a small path goes west towards a nobleman's
estate.  To the east, off in the distance, lies the great mountain.  It is
rumored that the Gods watch over and protect the empire from there.

   You are standing in the Emperor's private office.  The room is richly
furnished with the finest of the loot brought back from conquests of far
away lands.  There is a massive, intricately carved desk here, upon which
are important documents, decrees and other paperwork involved in running
the empire.  On the far wall, there is a marble bookcase that is well
stocked with the works of Homer, Plato, Socrates and other wise men.
Further, it seems that the current Emperor likes flowers as there are
many potted and cut specimens throughout the room.  There is a french

   You are standing in the mage's shop.  Magical ointments, charms and
potions are sitting on shelves and behind a glass counter.  There is a
dense neon blue fog hugging the floor here, making it impossible to see
below your knees.  You suddenly hear mutterings coming from the back
room, possibly from...
KKKKKAAAAAABBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
You are deafened by the noise from a tremendous explosion and the
concussion from the blast staggers you!  The shopkeeper seems to pay
no heed to this. The door to the back room opens and an older man,
wearing a pointed hat, whose face is smudged with soot sticks his head
out.  'Is everyone alright?  Sorry about that.  I was testing a new
spell.  I'll try to give advance notice next time.', he says.  The door

   You are standing in the workshop of Froboz the Great, the most powerful and
famous mage that Rome has ever known.  Workbenches line the walls and are
covered with various test tubes, beakers, petri dishes and crucibles and there
is an odor in here that can best be described as a combination of old sweat
socks and burning tires.  The only exit is back through the door through which
you came.  In the middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes that looks like it
once was a body and Froboz is is busy making adjustments on a new type of magic
wand...  Possibly the one responsible for the explosion a few minutes ago.  He
removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around.  'How in the name of
Merlin did you get in here??!!  ' he asks.  'Oh, nevermind!  Since you are here,
you can serve as witnesses to the final test of the new mages' spell:
"ectowatt".  ' With this he makes a magical gesture and a paladin appears.
Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and what happens next
is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to be a small, well
contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When the smoke clears you can see that the
paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a large pile of flaming
cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane glee.  'Now, my
young friends, what can I do for you?  ', he asks.

A Small Dirt Trail~
   This small dirt path seems to be a joint between a large clay road
located a short distance to the west and the expanse of sand which opens
up before you to the east.  The clay road appears to lead through the
foothills towards the snowcapped mountain chain to the west.  Perhaps
there is a city or settlement in that direction.
   You cannot see any breaks in the horizon of the sand which fills your
vision as you look to the east, it seems to stretch forever.
