Above The Motherboard~
   You are floating in some sort of ethereal chamber.  All about you, a
prismatic mist swirls about, as if it was alive.  A myriad of colors slowly
phases in and out of the mist.  What seems to be below you, is a massive
computer motherboard.  It must be close to a thousand times normal size.  You
can see the SIMM slots, the PCI slots, the cpu, and various other things found
on most motherboards.

portal~
   This portal has been fashioned from some sort of metal.  The portal itself
looks very futuristic, lights flash all about the portal, and things beep.
This portal is probably the work of some ancient Technomancer(computer

The corner of the motherboard.~
   You are standing in the northwestern corner of this huge silicon wonder.
The motherboard looks like any other, except for the fact that's a few thousand
times larger.  As you gaze about, you can see electrons zipping back and forth,
telling things what to do and when.  The circuitry beneath your feet is truly
amazing to behold.  Possible miles upon miles of high capacity circuits run
under your feet.  You can feel the pulse of electricity through them.

A microchip cluster.~
   You are standing in one of the many areas of the motherboard.  The prominent
feature of this area is the larger number of microchips that have been built
onto the motherboard.  The large black chips look like buildings now, and they
radiate an aura of power, as electrons race in and out of them.  You are also
on the western edge of the board.  Looking over, you get queasy, as the edge
just drops off into sheer nothingness.

An expanse of motherboard.~
   You are standing on a rather bare spot of the motherboard.  The usual is
here, circuits, and more circuits.  The odd thing is, the motherboard seems to
be growing, or something is coming up from under it.  Under the surface, you
can see large black masses moving up closer to the surface, ever so slowly.
You wonder what it could be.  After watching the black objects for a bit, you
get bored, and decide to search for something new.

A warped section of motherboard.~
   You are standing in a warped section of motherboard.  There are many, many
circuits here, criss-crossing each other.  The amount of power surging through
this area is probably tremendous.  The section of the motherboard seems to have
been misshapen from the large amount of heat, it's stretching out towards the
west.  Why it went that way, instead of sloping downwards, you have no idea.

An area of transistors.~
   There is a large number of transistors here.  This is probably a focal point
of the massive circuitry network.  Glancing down, you see a hideous creature
glancing upwards at you from within in the circuits.  You take a swipe at it
with your sword, cleaving deep into the circuit.  A small discharge of power
flies through your sword, but the hilt wrapping, and your gloves manage to
absorb most of it.  The odd thing is, that the circuit isn't shooting sparks
all over the place, it seemed to fuse itself back together, like clotting
blood.  The creature is not dead, nor was it ever there, it must've been some
weird illusion caused by all the electromagnetism going on here.

quite sharp, and would probably make a formidable spear.

   This is odd.  The motherboard is really warped here, stretching far out to
the west.  Wanting to find out what the hell is going on, you creep out to the
edge, and lie down on your belly.  You examine the edge of the motherboard, and
find it quite smooth, unlike typical silicon which has a rougher grain to it.
As you're getting up, you feel a slight lurch, and the motherboard has
stretched further out to the west.  A sudden look of mixed horror and surprise
comes across your face, and you find yourself short of breath.  "Great gods
above....  " you mutter.  "This thing is....  Alive....  " you say to no one in
particular.

make out what the black blobs were.  Coming out of the motherboard, are large
black blobs.  As they break the surface, they slowly harden, and form the giant
microchips that you see dotting the landscape.  "Heh....  This thing can grow,
and repair damaged areas.  A true silicon based life form...  " you utter to no
one in particular.

Off the edge of the motherboard.~
   Well, genius, you've stepped off the edge of the motherboard, even though
*I* expressely told you "One false step to the north would kill you.  " but
*NO* you think "Oh, he's just joking around.  " and you stepped off, thinking
you're all high and fucking mighty, well guess what, YOU'RE NOT.  As you fall,
and fall, and fall, into the depths, you look up and see the motherboard flying
away at high speeds.  You look down, and see nothing but mist.  You're probably
going to be falling forever.
