Cell A1~
   You're in a small, dark, prison cell. The dark stone walls look ancient,
and are quite damp. The dirt covered floor is made of cement, and a small hole
in the northwestern corner of the cell serves as a toilet. There is no bed,
no chairs, and no lights. This place obviously isn't maintained anymore. A
sturdy iron door leads south.
   A small notice has been engraved in the door.

|                  COOLAND PRISON - FOR CIRCLEMUD 3.1                 |

This zone is the jail on my MUD. Although highly unlikely, it is
possible to escape. On my MUD, I don't like throwing people into the
icebox or freezing them. When this happens, the player has no control
over anything. By putting them in a jail, the player has the
opportunity to escape, giving them control of the situation. The
locked jail cells can only be opened with a key found on the prison
guards, and since they are inaccessible by someone in a cell, a GOD or
IMP has to open the doors. Besides, a GOD or an IMP should visit the
player in jail anyway to advise them of their situation. The cell room
numbers are as follows:
Cell A1 - room #00           Cell A2 - room #08
Cell B1 - room #01           Cell B2 - room #09 (death trap)
Cell C1 - room #02           Cell C2 - room #10
As you can see, there are five functional jail cells, as cell B2 is a
death trap. If you need more than that, I think you're being pretty
mean to your players! :)
Ensure that the entrance to the jail (I have mine attached to the;my New Southern Midgaard, room # 3111) is either locked or inaccessible,
because you wouldn't want anyone to accidentally enter and be killed. I
like making the jail door accessible to everyone, that way a player
outside the jail has the chance to get in and rescue someone inside. I
have a jail bulletin board set up in the cafeteria, so you'll have to
remove it or add your own.
    Written entirely from scratch in WordPad. Feel free to edit, modify,
and do what you want with this zone!

   You're overwhelmed by the stink of rotting food. Several long wooden

chairs scattered around. At the far end of the room is a food counter,
and several stainless steel food bowls are sitting on it. That must be
where the stink is coming from. About a dozen rows of flickering lights
hang from the ceiling.

Cooland Prison~
   You're in the main entrance of the Cooland Prison. The walls are made
of thick cinderblocks, and the floor looks like it could support a freight
train. The three windows looking out onto Midgaard have thick bars across
them. An immensely huge thick metal door leads east. This must be the main
door that keeps the prisoners safely locked up. A large desk sits along the
northern wall, but it looks empty. Maybe this prison isn't maintained
anymore.
