Steps Leading Down to the Sea~
   You are on a long flight of steps cut into a cliff face.  Just above you, the
top of the steps looms, while below you, the steps continue for what seems an
eternity.

   *The Beach and Lighthouse - by Kaan for Dibrova
This zone is exactly what the title implies, nothing more to it than that.
There is a large lack of objs for this zone, it is suggested that some be
created for it, otherwise the zone would be quite bland.

Zone 265 is linked to the following zones:
258 Light Forest                   at 26500 (up   ) ---> 25874
255 Shipwreck                      at 26502 (east ) ---> 25531
255 Shipwreck                      at 26506 (down ) ---> 25507
282 Infernal Pit of Kerjim         at 26536 (north) ---> 28200

Down the Cliff-Face~
   The steps continue down toward the sea, or up to the crest of the cliff,
depending on the way you're heading.  It looks as if there may be some sort of
cave down from here.

On the Cliff Face~
   The stairs continue, however you are much closer to the bottom than the top
now.  There appears to be an opening in the rock to your east.  Inside you can
only see darkness, so it is possible that it is simply a natural fissure, but
then again, who knows?

On the Steps~
   Nearing the bottom, you really begin to get a good whiff of the clean sea air
as a breeze ruffles your clothing.  You begin to feel a bit better about your
day - the sea can do that to a person.

here.  The beach runs along east to west here as far as you can see.

Along the Beach~
   You stand on a beach which stretches east and west from here.  The waves, not
very large at this time, lap gently near your, making patterns in the fine sand.
To the west you see a few rocks jutting from the sand and sea.  East is flat
beach to the horizon.

Along the Beach~
   You stand on a beach which stretches east to west for as far as your eyes can
see.  Jumbles of rock and scree litter the way here, making it so you must watch
your step.  You notice a bit of wood, partially buried in the sand of the beach
here.  West is more rocky beach, while east the way gets a bit more flat.

Sandy Beach~
   You stand on a sandy beach which runs along the shore east to west.  To the
east you can just barely make out the rooftops of a large city which sits
nestled in a cove on the shore of the ocean.  To your west you see that the
beach gets a bit rockier than where you currently stand.  A set of steps lead up
the cliff face just to the west of you.

Sandy Beach~
   The beach continues it's way east toward what appears to be a large coastal
town.  A large pier juts out into the sea, ships dot the horizon as far out to
sea as you can see from the city.  To your west you may continue along the
beach.

Sandy Beach~
   The beach slopes upwards, slowly, gently toward the city to your east which
sits on a huge plateau.  You can now hear the sounds of a great many voices
coming from that direction, however traffic along this beach is at a bare
minimum, which is to say not at all.  There must be another entrance into the
city somewhere.  To your west, the beach continues into the western horizon.

The Base of the City~
   You stand at the edge of the sea shore staring at a huge rock formation which
could be described (sort of) as a plateau rising up out if the ocean floor and
holding a massive walled city atop it.  To the north is the cliff face you have
been following, which happens to put an end to this path just a little ways
northeast from your current position.  West the path heads along the beach for
quite a long distance.

distance, you can see a lighthouse out at the end of a jetty, it's gentle light
guiding sailors safely past this rocky area.

at it's end.

Rocky Path~

Takker's Jetty~
   All along the jetty, men relax in the sun, sitting in comfortable niches in
the rocks where they can wile away their time telling tall tales about 'the ones
that got away', discussing politics, or every now and then, doing some fishing.

Just south of these cramped stucco walls is the main living room of the
lighthouse.  You can hear and smell a crackling, warm fire in the fireplace, a
dog's contented panting, and the sound of a young lady's laughter from the next
room.

Main Living Area - Lighthouse~
   This large room looks as if it has spent many happy times in the company of
the Lighthouse Keeper and his family.  The dinner table looks as if it always
would have room for one more, the fire always warm and comforting, and of
course, Max would always be around to play catch or get his ears scratched.  To
the east, you see what looks to be one of the family's bedrooms, the same to the
west.  Both have doors, but both doors are wide open.  A spiral stairway leads
up into the lighthouse top, where the Keeper must spend a great deal of his
time.

houses the light.  A narrow walkway encircles the light, so that regular
maintenance can be performed.  Some shelves on the walls hold tools and oils
which keep the machinery in fine tune so that no ships run afoul of the many
rocks in this part of the ocean.

On the Spiral Staircase~
   You have begun a descent down into the Lower Reaches of the Lighthouse.  You
wonder why the basement of this happy home would not only be called the 'Lower
Reaches', but also capitalized for a moment - and then you see what lies below
you.  Looking almost like a medieval torture chamber, you see a room all in
stone, a deep cavernous hole in the center of it.  What looks to be am operating
table is set to one side with tables covered in instruments of dissection and
bubbling vials close by.  Do you really wish to descend into that room and visit
with the 'good' Lighthouse Keeper?

   You see all and more of what you saw from the staircase.  Four cells lie in
all cardinal directions, each with a whimpering human subject in it!  Diagrams
cover the walls, notes jotted on many of them, all dealing with one goal in mind
- the creation of the perfect sexual companion!  It seems the 'good Lighthouse
Keeper' may be a bit more than everyone believes him to be...

in this space, it has been spruced up just a bit.  A huge bed dominates the
ENTIRE room, pillows strewn everywhere with lace and frills and all.

Rocky Path~
   You stand on a rocky beach path near the mouth of a cave.  The entrance to
the cave must be at least thirty feet high and just as wide.  It doesn't look as
if anything could live there, as the water from the sea laps right inside the
cave, but then, you never know.

   You realize that if you wish to explore the confines of this cave, you will
have to get wet.  As you stand looking into the cold, wet, darkness of the cave,
the idea of jumping into that water just for the sake of exploring does seem a
bit nutty.

here, no longer leaving the little bit of beach that you have been enjoying just
west and south and here.  Strange that a path would end so abruptly at a cliff
without leading anywhere...  Oh well!
