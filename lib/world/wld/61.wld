Up In The Tree~
   You are hanging on the outside of a huge tree trunk covered in a sticky
substance.  Directly to the west is an immense spider web suspended between
numerous of the giant trees including the one you are hanging on.  To the
north is what looks like a large webbed entrance.

On The spider web~
   You are balancing carefully on the giant sticky threads that holds the
giant web in place.  To the east is a giant tree trunk and to the west is
an entrance to a cave-like structure made from many layers of spider web.

The Den Of The Queen Spider~
   You are inside a cave-like structure that seems to be made entirely
from countless layers of spider web.  Temperature and humidity is very
high making it hard to breathe the foul air that lingers here.  The walls
are covered with open cocoons.

   The trail continues to the north and south as it leads through
the heavy underbrush of this part of the Haon-Dor Forest.  Ancient
gray trees loom all around you.  The brush seems to be bending
closely over the path in a somewhat ominous manner, but you easily
shrug it off.  The trail looks to open up somewhat a short distance
to the south.
