   x---------------------------------------------------------------------x
    This is the first zone I ever wrote. It's based on the original 1968
    Planet of the Apes movie. The zone is currently attached to the world
    north of room 6090, which is just before the forest west of Midgaard.

    Written entirely from scratch in WordPad. Feel free to edit, modify,
    and do what you want with this zone!

against the walls, with test tubes and beakers littered all over. One of
the tables appears to be used in surgery, as several medical tools can
be seen on it. Dr. Zaius is fond of performing lobotomies, especially
on humans.

   You're on a wide sandy beach. The soft sand seems much nicer than
the coarse sand found in the Forbidden Zone. The ocean to the east
stretches as far as the eye can see, and small waves gently lap on the
shore. A high cliff blocks your way west. A huge dark green statue is
resting right on the side of the beach. It's a woman wearing a large
spikey crown holding a book, so it must be the ruins of the Statue of
Liberty! Damn them all to hell!

   You're on a wide sandy beach. The soft sand seems much nicer than
the coarse sand found in the Forbidden Zone. The ocean to the east
stretches as far as the eye can see, and small waves gently lap on the
shore. A high cliff blocks your way west and south. Too bad the apes
don't like swimming, because this place is perfect for it!

Statue of Liberty Stairs~
   You're on a staircase leading up the Statue of Liberty. Back when
this place wasn't wrecked, people used to come here to tour the
statue and to get a nice view of New York. Now, the staircase is
full of cobwebs and many large cracks can be seen along the walls.

Statue of Liberty - Main Observatory~
   You're in the main observatory of the Statue of Liberty. Several
sets of coin operated binoculars look out onto the ocean through
the long broken windows. Dirt and grime covers all of the walls.
A heap of rags is on the floor towards the northern part of the
room, which looks like it may be a bed. An old staircase leading
down is built into the eastern wall.
