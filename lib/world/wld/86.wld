Zone         : 86 Duke Kalithorn's Keep
Began        :
Player Level : 3-14

Plot         : This will be the Keep of Grand Duke Kalithorn (it can be renamed
   to fit into the mud..it was just something I came up with) a mercenary
   turned politician/good guy after his wife was kidnapped by bandits. The Duke
   swore that he would not rest until his wife was found and the bandits
   punished.so he is 'haunting' (for lack of a better word) the Keep.
Links        : 60s, 01w
Notes        : Within a forest or perhaps a little set back from a main road.
   Neutral to slightly evil. Most of the mobs would be rats, bats and sprites
   which would be the evil aligned mobs. Kalithorn and his undead guards and
   sentinels would be of neutral align.
Zone 86 was linked to the following zones:

   The trees part just north revealing an even smaller dirt road.  The road

enormous crack runs diagonally from the top left corner downwards to the bottom

there are many, many cracks and dents and the bottom left forner of the mirror
has been broken off.  The wall paper had long ago cracked and peeled off the
western wall, but the eastern wall still holds a small wooden shelf with a few
cobweb covered books.

walls are smooth and covered with tapestries at random intervals.  Some bear
scenes of battles, castles and another on the far east wall bears the likeness

the rushing noise that echoes through the other caverns.  It gently pours from

An enormous king sized bed stands in the center of this huge master bedroom.
The bed curtains are the same deep red and have been tied off at the four
posts.  The bed clothes are dusty and rumpled.  The walls are covered with
ornamental tapestries that have faded over time and the red striped wallpaper
is bubbled in spots and is peeling from the walls between them.  A medium sized
closet stands open to the north and a pair of etched glass doors lead out to a
balcony.

   The painstakingly stched glass paneled doors were once beautiful.  Now a few
panels are shattered and the others are scratched beyond repair.

   These huge paneled doors must be at least four handlengths wide.  The panels
depict scenes from various battles in history.  The silver handles are
tarnished, but not too worn.

tapestries tapestry~
   Most of the tapestries have faded beyond recognition but one singular
tapestry nearest to the main doors proudly displays the Kalithorn coat of arm.

Bedroom Closet~
   Cobwebbed and moth infested this closet once held the beautiful and numerous
dresses of Lady Kalithorn.  Hangers dangle on the somewhat empty racks and
rat-chewed shoes lay in haphazard piles along the floor.  Curiously, though,
the row of boxes on the uppermost shelf seem untouched.  The master bedroom is
to the south.

A Dirt Road~
   The path winds gently around fallen trees and brush.  To the north it begins
to ascend up a hill.  The wind feels colder and the forest is quieter.  A
disturbing silence fills this part of the woods.

A Dirt Road~
   The woods around you consists mostly of pine and small fir.  Small animals
can be heard, but not seen, scurrying away as you intrude upon their home.
The path is beginning to fade and recede back into the forest.

Western Wing~
   The floorboards creak and groan dangerously underfoot.  The splintering of
wood and the muffled sqeaks of rats and other unsavory creatures can be heard
to the west.  Unfortunetly, the walls have caved in to the north and south.
To the west the floor slopes sharply downward into the darkness.
