The Edge Of The Water~
   The pool side is dimly lit up by your light.  You can see absolutely
nothing else nearby.  The darkness her seems enormously oppressive here.
The air is damp and the rock on which you stand is slippery.  The pool
seems too dark to make anything clear.  The pool seems to extend to the
east.  The rock can be climbed upwards from here.

Under The Mudhole~
   You stand in a small room with a great big opening in the ceiling.  From
this opening there is mud dripping down in large lumps.  >YUCK<.  You can
smell the foul stench of the slimy sediment as you try not to get covered
by the falling sludge.  To the east there is an entryway leading out from
here and it seems absolutely impossible to force the muddy descent.

Under The Dark Pit~
   Nice place you found yourself in.  You stand in the middle of a room
with only two exits, up and east.  A tall ladder has been left here so
that you can climb up through the pit without the use of a rope.

A Muddy Bend In The Sewer System~
   You are standing in what looks like a bend in the pipe system of the
sewer.  The 'floor' is covered completely by mud!  This includes covering
your legs up to your knees as well.  The pipe leads west and south.

Down The Old Well~
   You are dangling on the slippery sides of the old well leading down and
up.  The only secure point here is the metal bars that are cemented into the
sides, the ones that you cling frantically to so that you don't fall.  Who
knows how deep this well is?  The bars lead down and up and nowhere else.

Down there nothing at all can be spotted.  The darkness that engulfs this

torch down there would be utterly useless... or so it seems to you.  Not
the kind of thing to cheer you up on this voyage, Eh?

The Northwestern Corner Of The Ledge~
   You stand, swaying out from the ledge, with only a couple of inches of
safe, solid ledge under your feet.  The ledge continues to the east but not
back south.  It seems that the ledge is too narrow to turn on so you'll have
to continue forward.

The Narrow Ledge~
