The Study~
   You are in a large study.  Shelves filled with many books or arcane
knowledge are on every wall.  A large oaken desk is in the center, with
many parchments and scrolls on it.  The most notable thing in the room is
a small set of scales, which floats about eye level.  In perfect balance,
the scales are no doubt a sign of the Master's neutrality.

tangible in its thickness.  A deep sense of fear and loathing comes over
you.
   A pair of obsidian doors can be seen to the east.

The Chamber Of Darkness~
   You are in a vast chamber.  The walls fade into darkness, leaving you
with a very vague idea of the actual size of the room.  Swirling here and
there in the dark, are patches of pure black which seem to suck in your
light and leave it that much darker here.

A Torture Chamber~
   You are in an ill lit chamber.  Instruments of torture hang from a rack
on the wall, they seem to quiver with anticipation of a victim as if they
had a mind of their own.  An operating table is here, though it is bare.
   An extreme feeling of evil permeates the entire area.

   You are in a small dark chamber.  Upon the walls are glowing sigils of
dark power, scrawled and traced in an evil language no longer known to most
of this plane of existence.  There is an obsidian altar here which seems to
glow, but does not shed any light, in fact it seems to be taking light in.

of light cannot be seen.  It is almost as if the room itself exudes a warm
glow of goodness.  A larger chamber can be seen to the west, but you do not
feel worthy to pass into it.

The Chamber Of The White Light~
   You are in a vast chamber, its walls floor and ceiling are of an
unknown metallic material, the brightest white, almost blindingly stark.
A flickering flame is in the center of the room, seeming to feed off of
darkness and cleansing the room of any evil.  You feel a slight tug at
your being as the flame flickers towards you.

mess all around them, the master of this chamber obviously can.

   You are in a large chamber.  Small bolts of energy leap from wall to
wall, crackling with power.  The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors
and patterns ever changing.  Bright bursts of color seem to explode into
the air and fade again at random times.  All this splendor plays about and
draws attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be
cut from a single enormous emerald.

to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

altar.  Many icons to lesser deities line the room, but it is obvious by
one glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for
the worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
in the event speedy of a evacuation.

all sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
   An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be
an exit.
