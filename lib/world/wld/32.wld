Under The Bridge~
   The arch under the bridge is covered by seaweed about a foot above the
surface of the river.  The water gently flows through an opening in the lower
part of the city wall.

   It is built from large gray rocks that have been fastened to each other with
some kind of mortar.  Looks pretty solid.

On The River~
   North of here you see the miserable buildings of Poor Alley.  The
river flows west towards the bridge.  The riverbanks are too steep to
climb.

On The River~
   The river enters from a hole in the eastern city wall.  The hole has been
blocked by several vertically positioned iron bars set into the wall.

The iron bars make it difficult to pass through the hole in the wall.
Beyond the bars you see that the river leads into a cavern below the
mountain range to the east.
