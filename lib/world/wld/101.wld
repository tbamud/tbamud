forest towers before you just south of here while to the north there is nothing
but open land on both sides of the road.  To the east you see the road turn
south again as to avoid getting too close to the mountains not far off in the
distance.  The mountains provide some cover for the desert winds but you can
just feel them here, warm winds blowing in from the east as if to remind you of
the mysteries hidden there.

The South Road~
   The road leads off to the south like a giant snake eating its way through the
hills in between a dense forest to the west and the mountains to the east.
Sounds from unseen, and probably even unknown, animals can be heard from the
forest to the west but at this point you see no way of entering the dense shrubs
and woods preventing entrance to the adventures which are likely to be within.
The wind here is a strange blend of hot dry desert air and biting cold from the
mountain glaciers.

from here towards the mountains.
