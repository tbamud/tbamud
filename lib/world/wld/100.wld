Inside a Small Cabin~
   As you step into the shabby cabin, the smell makes you gag.  A slight haze
makes your eyes sting.  Whoever lives here has no regard for cleanliness.
Piles of rags lie everywhere.

In Front of the Hermit's Cabin~
   You stop and stare at the decrepit bundle of sticks that must be where some
recluse hermit lives.  You can't imagine living out here, beyond the safety of
the city walls.  Thick forests block any exit to the north and you can see the
city wall to the south.

Along the City Wall~
   As you walk by the city wall, you notice the forest is getting thicker.  A
slight gloom hangs over this part of the woods.  You start to walk a little
faster.  Further to the west you can see a small clearing with something that
looks like a shack.

Along the City Wall~
   The few animals in this part of the forest scatter as you walk by.  The
forest is thickening slightly, a little less sunlight is making it to the forest
floor.  Overhead you can hear birds chirping and squirrels chattering.  This
place feels very peaceful.

The Northern Road~
   You are standing at the beginning of the road to the city of the Minotaurs,
Dun Maura.  Many rumors abound of these savage beasts but few leave the city
walls to explore.  To the north you see a thick forest.  To the east and west
are small paths along the city wall.

Along the City Wall~
   The forest along this part of the wall is thinnning out.  Further east it
looks as if the forest disappears all together and turns into a grassy plain.
Small innocent forest creatures abound in this healthy forest.

Along the City Wall~
   The forest is almost completely gone now, replaced by tall fields of grass as
far as the eyes can see.  An unnatural cold breeze blows from the east.  You
have a sudden urge to head back towards the safety of the forest, or even better
yet, back to the city.

A Dead End~
   Because of the tall grass, you almost stumble right into a massive crevice to
the east.  It looks impossible to cross.  You have no choice but to head back
west.  These plains give you an eerie feeling anyways.

blocking your vision.  It would be very easy for someone, or something, to sneak
up on you here.  You can continue north or east through the forest.

The Northern Road~
   The northern road is made of hard dirt.  Packed solid from years of use from
both travelers, merchants, and peddlers.  Wagon tracks leave small ruts in the
road.  To the west is some thick woodlands, while to the east you think you can
make out some plains in the distance.  The road continues north or south.

south you can hear the sound of rushing water.  West you stare into a dismal
swampland.  The stories you've heard about getting lost in those plains makes
you decide to stick closer to civilization.

   The northern road hugs the edge of the pond to the east.  The forest to the
west looks too thick to bother leaving the easy travelling of this road.  The

walk in the muddy swamp.  It feels good to be on dry ground for a change.  The

have been a minotaur. You can just barely make out some horns and one leg floating
in the muck has a hoove.
