In The Forest~
   The trail ends here where the mountains begin abruptly.
Looking up, you note that the climb would be rough,
hazardous, and probably not worth the effort; the energy
barrier continues up the mountain side out of sight.  The
only exit is back to the east.

to the end of the forest, and back east.  Each way the
strange energy barrier stands just to the north,
inscrutable, magical, and impenetrable.

   This trail runs parallel to the energy barrier to your

west that form the boundries of this valley.  Walking
along, you scare a small squirrel, which leaps through
the barrier without a second thought!  Your hand is still
repulsed by the magical field, however.

background.  For a short moment, you wonder if the field
is keeping something in, or you out.  It makes you

penetrating the magical field, however.

Several poles with skulls on top face to the west, warning

smells of death and decay, and the air is very still.  You

A Clearing In The Forest~
   Several trails in the forest intersect here in a small
clearing.  The dirt seems matted down, and you see many
footprints in the soil.   Nearby you hear a bird's chirp
abruptly cut off in a loud squawk, and then silence.  The
paths seem well-traveled, the undergrowth matted down and
the foliage hacked away to leave plenty of room or a
traveller to pass in every cardinal direction, excepting
the west path seems fairly overgrown...
   You feel watched.

A Tunnel~
   The floor is slick with the humidity that boils out of
the lower reaches of this cave, bringing that most awful
smell with it.  Again, you consider saving your nose the
trip west and down the tunnel, and heading back east to
the cave entrance.

A Tunnel~
   The tunnel takes a deep dip here, and opens up into a
largish cave to the west.  There seems to be a few faint
lights from inside, and you hear some heavy breathing and
low grunts from that direction.  The cave entrance to the
east seems far too far away for your comfort...

A Cave~
    Heaps of rotting meat and cups of near-drinkable water
sit here; the orc food stores.  You stand here and wonder
in near-disbelief at how the orcs could find this stuff
palatable.  They're orcs; its their nature and their
stomachs you guess.  Oddly enough, you don't even care to
catalog what they have available -- there's no chance you're
going to take any of this...

A Cave~
   A single corpse lies here, well away from a pile of
similars to the east.  There are several sharpened stakes
and rocks sitting about conveniently.  The way the corpse
is lying, the stone next to its hand... this is a suicide
area!  You look down upon the orc and comprehend its
suffering in its twisted form.  How sad.

A Cave~
   There are bodies here... corpses.  Orcs, the lot of
them, every single one of them horribly disfigured in
some senseless way; one whose arms were removed, another
who lacks anything that could sensibly be called a face.
A few twitch feebly with the last remains of life, the
rest just decompose.  The dim sense of horror budding in
your head blossoms as you realize the pile in the corner
consists of dead orc children awaiting burial.

A Cave~
   A few sleeping pallets, made of moldy straw and
stinking furs are arranged around a small firepit here.
A wooden cup, carved by a crude tool and cruder hands
sits near the ashes filled with water you consider
undrinkable.  Somewhere to the east you hear an orc
child's whining cry, and a voice hushes it urgently.
Beware, orcs!  Adventurers are here!  Hide your children!

A Cave~
   Several grass sleeping pallets are here, clustered
around the remains of an old fire.  The sloping of the
cave's ceiling allow for smoke ventilation towards the
surface in here you note, lucky for the orcs.  A few
strings of burnt meat still hang over the fire, untended
and uneaten.  On the floor near your feet you spy a small,
twisted piece of wire... one orc's idea of a treasured ring,
no doubt.  Kicking the trinket away, you try to push the
pity out of your heart for these wretches.

A Cave~
   You are standing just inside a largish cave, about a
hundred feet in diameter.  A few dim make-shift lanterns
burning animal fat illuminate the area, just enough so you
can see the rotted food on the floor, and a few bodies
sprawled throughout the whole area.  Your disgust quickly
turns to horror as you see a horrible creature, half...
well, half something and half orc dash between two
stalagmites.

A Cave~
   This must be the orc chief's area.  There's an old
prize -- a stolen timeworn human armchair sitting near
the south wall as a throne.  A mammoth sleeping pallet
made of piled furs is nearby.  Next to that is the pile
of orc treasure; a pile of well-polished coppers.  You
look at the pile of worthless coins and wonder at the
image of orcish raiders.
   These orcs aren't raiders, they are victims.

   Many sleeping pallets are arranged near the walls, each
made of heavy fur padding for comfort and warmth.  Many
are covered with blood and other, unidentifiable
substances.  Looking around, your only coherent thought
is, 'Don't want to know... don't want to know...'

A Cave~
   This area of the cave is one vast orc sickroom.
Mutated and mangled orcs lie on the floor, seeming quiet,
lifeless.  They're not even worth your time, you think,
unless you've the mercy to put them out of their misery.
   You look at the corruption of nature's design and
wonder what forces are at work here... the barrier, the
orcs...  What's going on here?

A Tunnel~
   This forking off from the mail tunnel seems odd; the
walls are strangely smooth, as if they were carved out by
forces unknown.  The end is abrupt and short, but there is
a steel door inset in the wall of the west side of the
tunnel.  The smell from the lower tunnel doesn't seem
nearly as bad here... this might be a good place to rest
and catch your breath.

A Tunnel~
   This section of man-made tunnel heads north from here,
doors on either side.  A few glowing spots on the ceiling
illuminate the area to almost a daylight level.  From the
north you hear some horrible cries of pain and anguish
that make you cringe inside and think twice about heading
in that direction.

   This is a bedroom, catered to someone with a definite
sense of taste.  There's a chest of drawers made of a
solid section of oak tree.  In fact, most of the furniture
here has that 'natural look' about it.  The bed is filled
with soft down with an ornate table lamp close by.  Nice
place.

A Tunnel~
   This tunnel opens up into a large room to the north,
and to the south, leads towards a set of doors.  The light
is crisp and bright, clearly showing the lack of tool
marks on the hewn walls... magic?  The room just ahead is
large, and also well-lighted, giving it an almost clinical
atmosphere.  Somewhere in the recesses of that room
something cries out in a horrible crackling voice.  Not
good.

   A full fledge operating table is set up here, outfitted
with a full set of restraints.  A ledge nearby has a whole
array of sterile medical equipment on it, covered over by
a clear lid.  There's a drain in the floor with gradients
leading to it to carry away the blood.  For some reason,
you don't imagine this as a voluntary operating theater...

   Some small cages sit here, containing many different
types of rodents.  Leaning down to look better, you are
very surprised as a tiny, common garden mouse growls at
you and tries to rip your face off through the bars.
There are some bulges on its back, and it doesn't seem to
be in a very good mood.  It quivers some, not fully in
control of its motor functions.  Poor thing.
