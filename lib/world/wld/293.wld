Entrance to the Blue Trials~
   You enter the musty area beneath the blue temple and stop in awe.
The stonework here is simply incredible--a combination of dwarven
stonemanship and elven artistry.  On the wall there is an inscription:
'Only those who brave the elder beasts may arrive safely at the orb.'
   There is a door to the east.

   It seems that door you just passed through disappeared behind you!
The only way to go is forward, then, deeper into the passages.  You're
not sure if you feel comfortable about this...

strewn about.  Unfortunately, the door DID disappear behind you

Trial~
   This is a large rectangular room with three exits, doors to the
north, east and west.  The door you've come from has...disappeared!
You are not surprised, however.  There are some strange scuff marks on
the floor, and you'd swear that discoloration is an old bloodstain.

laughs evilly as he takes a vicious dagger and disembowls himself,
spilling organs all over his feet and the floor.

laughs, and directs his minions to attack!

from a mud!"  You feel relief.

View of a City~
   Incredible! From this vantage point you see a huge city to your
east, large enough to hold thousands of people.  Great walls encircle
the city, no doubt to keep the marauding monsters at bay.  The city is
in a VERY defensible spot in that over half its length is sprawled
along the edge of a cliff.  Beyond the cliff you see a dark ocean,
reflecting the starlight above very feebly.  The road continues west
down the rise, and east, towards the city on the edge.

west is a rise where you may get a better vantage point of the city.

fields, tended by farmers who seem paranoid and quick.  The vegetables
they are harvesting seem pale and lifeless by your standards, with a few
you've never seen the likes of before.  From several burned out shells of
houses you guess the farmers just try to grow what they can before the
city is put under siege again.
