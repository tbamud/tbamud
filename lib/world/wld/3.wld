A Long Hallway~
   The hall stretches north and south.  Lanterns set in brackets along the wall
offer ample lighting.  The smokeless kerosene that is used leaves a strange
smell.  The Hall is bare, only a few small paintings cover the walls.  Clerics
have very little need for decorations of any kind.  A small waiting room is to
the west.

Clerics Avenue~
   The cobblestone road is in decent shape, though a few stones have been
overturned leaving gaping holes.  No wagons travel down this part of the city.
Everyone knows clerics have no need for anything besides what they can provide
by themselves.

Sanctus or go south towards the southern gate.  The southern half of the city

Magi's Quarter.  Accidents have been known to happen around here.  People must
be careful for who knows what an inexperienced student may do.

ranging from ogres, orcs, goblins, and demons to humans, elves, and dwarves.
One of the paintings looks oddly familiar.

   The air is musky and hard to breathe due to the hot steam wafting from the
large copper tubs filled with hot water.  A large fire with pots of water
heating over it fills the eastern wall.  These baths are only to be used by the
magi whom believe cleanliness is next to godliness.

pristine white, without even a speck of dust.  The Cleric's of Sanctus lead a
disciplined life, second to none, not even the soldiers.

A Long Hallway~
   The barren walls and floor would seem odd anywhere but here as the Clerics of
Sanctus consider decorations, desires, or any form of unnecessary wants to be
blasphemous.  They dedicate their lives to helping others, never themselves, and
would all sacrifice their lives for that principle.

the Tower of the High Council which seems to glow because of its glaring

Clerics Alley~
   Within the Clerics' Quarters an adventurer has very little to worry about.
Even those would be vandals, pickpockets, and thugs shy away out of their
respect of the clerics.  To be a cleric is to be respected second only to that
of the Master Magi.

The massive fortification of rock and mortar is impressive, rising at least two
or maybe three times the average man's height.  One can just make out a small
walkway on the top of the wall, too bad only the guards know where the entrance
is.

smaller.  Far up in the tower you can see people walking by windows in white
flowing robes.  The healers within are known for their miraculous abilities in
restoring the wounded.

especially about the Orb of Sanctum the gods left in the Master Magi's care.

   The inner city wall is used to separate the city into two separate

back into the inner city as a last measure of defense.  Luckily, the army has
been very successful in protecting the city and it has never come to that.

that it is almost at the point of becoming an eyesore.  The Tower contains the
fabled Orb of Sanctum, but few are ever lucky enough to lay their eyes on it.

hurled from the battlements by the Magi.

prayer.  The walls are unadorned, everything looks to be plain and only used for

badly bruised and possibly broken and begins chanting mysterious words.  The
bruises fade away without a trace.

The Tower of the Magi~
   A pair of circular stairwells wind their way higher into the tower.  The
sounds of people chanting echo off the pitch black walls that almost appear
depthless.  Most likely a simple trick of the eye, but then again, maybe not.

The Tower of the Magi~
   Everything is made from black stone, which at first glance appears to be
marble, but upon closer examination has no grain within it.  Looking into the
wood causes one to lose themselves as they peer further and further into the
blackness.  It is impossible to tell if this is caused by magic or just a simple
trick of the eye.  To the east is the center of the Magi Quarters.

The Magi Quarters~
   This is the heart of the Magi Quarters.  The Magi Mansion where they can be
found when they are not guarding the orb is to the east.  Also nearby is the
pure black Tower of the Magi which houses the sacred orb that protects the city.

The Magi Mansion~
   The walls are adorned in fancy draperies and expensive tapestries of every
style and design imaginable.  The Magi believe in a life of service to their
discipline, but they also believe that they should be able to live in comfort.
This building is one of the most elaborate within the entire city.

A Study~
   Three low hanging lanterns positioned over the rooms large tables illuminate
the book-lined walls.  There are several chairs at each table so as to allow
those who wish to study the fine art of magic to rest comfortably.  Several
books lay open upon the tables.  Occasional trickles of smoke waft in from under
the doorway to the east.

The Healer's Shop~
   Small indoor gardens have been set up within this small house to grow the
herbs required for the mixes and salves the clerics require.  They are rumored
to sometimes sell some of their remedies, though this is very rare and at a very
steep price.

Clerics in Training~
   Several beds lie in columns and rows spaced evenly apart.  The smell of some
form of antiseptic stings in the air.  All the beds are empty, must be the
healers here are well-versed in their craft.  The Temple continues to the north
and west.

A Large Basin~
   A large basin of water lies against the southern wall.  Small statues
portraying a woman and children playing on a river's edge surround the edge of
basin.  The water inside the basin is extremely clean and sterily, likely used
by the the clerics to tend for the wounded.

Clerics' Hallway~
   The smell of exotic medicines fills the entire tower.  A large open area to
the north, the center of the tower, holds a set of stairs leading higher up into
the tower.  Small benches line the walls here, allowing people to rest from
their adentures.

A Waiting Room~
   Benches filled with people waiting to see a healer line the walls here.  An
apprentice does what he can to aid these poor people, but it is obvious that
many of them need to be attended to shortly by a real healer or else they may
perish.

The Southern Road~
   To the east the Tower of the High Council of Clerics glows a bright white,
its polished surfaces reflecting all light down onto the Clerics' Quarters which
it protects.  To the west the Tower of the Magi does the exact opposite, seeming
to absorb all light surrounding it.  There must be balance in all things.

The Magi Training Room~
   Bookshelves line the two walls of this small open area within the tower.
The smell of dust and musty old papers emanates from them.  Many centuries of
knowledge lie within these books that were salvaged from the lands beyond.
Many more have yet to be found.

A Tower Hallway~
   Through a small door to the north one can see the center of the tower where a
set of spiral staircases lead to the second floor.  The Orb of Sanctum is
protected somewhere within this tower.  The Master Magi have been given the task
of ensuring its safety.

The Magi Hallway~
   The seven Orders of the Magi are slowly dying out.  That is why they rarely
fight in battles any longer.  They have instead devoted their time to training
future Magi to take their places.  But, good students have become even harder
to come by these days.

A Magi Training Room~
   Short tables with cushions surrounding them are placed about the room.
These cushions are obviously meant to kneel on and the tables are overflowing
with various books.  This must be some sort of study room for the Magi.  The
black walls seem to absorb the white light coming from strange bulbs hanging
from the ceiling.

Sareth's Scrolls~
   The smell of old paper that is slowly crumbling to dust fills the room.
Thousands of books, scroll, parchments, and even some tablets fill the
bookshelves, tables and the floor of this under sized room.  It is here a vast
amount of the Magi have left thei findings when delving into the depths of
their magic.

The Southern Gate~
   The heavily fortified passage between the gate and the wilderness beyond is
well protected against an attack.  Lookouts can be heard above chatting idly
while the sentinel guards stand at attention waiting to be called into action.

The Stables~
   The smell of hay and manure clings to the room like a cheap cologne
somebody's grandmother might wear.  Stalls line both sides of the cramped
building with bales of hay stacked everywhere.  The horses can't reach the hay
though they all seem to still try.  It is possible to buy a horse for a minimal
fee, but not all of them are well tamed and have been known to become ornery.

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   To make a pet shop you need two rooms and some pets. The rooms MUST be
sequential. If the first room is 3015 then the second must be 3016. The second
room is known as the storeroom. All that is required in the storeroom is to
load one of each mob you wish to be a pet. This room can not have any exits and
will never be used by mortals. Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is
recommended. In order to implement a pet shop the actual mud code has to be
modified. Just ask Rumble to do it for you.

On the Window Ledge~
   From this perilous perch an excellent view is available of the southern half
of the city.  A gust of wind howls past threatening to pull anything along with
it.  The only exit is back into the tower or a deadly jump to the cobblestone
road below.

The Lab~
   The room is covered in shadow and what little that can be seen is a clutter
of books, scrolls, and potions. The entire room is scarred from fire and a fine
ash covers everything. Smoke still lingers in the rafters overhead.

Hazel's Living Quarters~
   The room is cluttered with various water container and filtration canisters
overflowing the desks and shelves.  A small cot is crowded into one corner.
Though there is very little room to move around the room is surprisingly clean
and well kept.  A single door leads down to the shop below.

Welcome to the Builder Academy~
   A builder is a term usually used to describe a person who designs MUD zones
for other characters to explore. Any player with motivation, ideas, and good
writing style can be a builder as well as a player. As a Builder, your job is
to create the virtual world in which players can roam around, solve puzzles,
find treasures, and gain experience. A Builder creates the rooms, objects,
mobs, shops, and triggers with which players will interact.
   If this is something you are interested in doing then you have come to the
right place. Be warned, building is not easy and will require hard work,
patience, and the ability to take constructive criticism.
   Your first task is to apply for builder status at:
http://tbamud.com/
   When you finish and submit the application tell anyone level 32 or higher
and they will advance you to begin your training.

   If would like to check out the tbaMUD World as a player connect to tbamud.com 4000.
