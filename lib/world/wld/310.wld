Aten's Zone Description Room~
   Graye Area
Written March 1994
Graye consists of a forested area, a cliff to scale,
a small wooded area around a town, a small town, a small
castle, some underground passageways, and a bunch of mid-level
mobs and eq.

Enclosed is an area I wrote back in my mudding days; they
are designed for circle code, but with some modifications can probably
be integrated into whatever kind of mud you're running.

These areas are FREE- however, if you use them:
1. Feel free to make whatever modifications you need, change mobs,
objects, room descriptions etc.- but please make sure that signs and author
references are unmodified and readable by players.
2. Please send me an e-mail message if you do use them, I'd just
like to have some idea of where they end up (please include mud site)- my
address is wjp@hopper.unh.edu until Sept 1996
3. If you redistribute these areas, please make sure this README
file goes with them :)

The Great Field~
   You are standing in a great field of tall grass.  The smell of fresh dirt
and sunlight surrounds you.  The air is filled with the sound of chirping birds
happily building their nests in the depths of the knotted grass.  A wagon trail
runs in an east-south direction.

The Forest's Edge~
   The grassland fades to spotted scrub here, and finally merges into a great
line of trees.  To the far north a stormcloud hangs in the air ominously, but
strangely enough it is still quite pleasant out.  Crickets chirp merrily, and
the sun's rays warm your skin.  The wagon trail leads eastwards back into the
grassland, and dissapears westwards into the forest.

Entrance to the Forest of Graye~
   The trail passes into the shade here, and the temperature drops quite
suddenly.  Great broad leaf trees gather the descending sunlight, and cover the
leaf-strewn forest floor with dappled sunlight.  The wagon trail becomes much
wider here, showing signs of recent heavy use.  The wagon trail runs from west
to east here, and it looks possible to venture into the forest to the north and
south.

Hanging By a Thread~
   As you reach for your next handhold, the rock comes loose and tumbles down,
down, down to the ground.  You barely manage to save yourself by clinging
desperately to the rock face with your other hand.  Returning back west is out
of the question, but you might be able to pull yourself upwards onto a very
thin ledge.

a nap if you wanted too.  To the south you get a fantastic view of the entire
forest.  There is perhaps another forty feet to the top of the cliff, all of
which appears to be an easy climb.

Oops.~
   "Aaarrrggg!  ", you scream as you plummet toward the earth.  The ground
rushes up at you at a dizzying pace, and you prepare for impact.  Suddenly,
there is a flash of blinding light, and you feel yourself floating in white
light.  You notice a glint in Aten's eye.  "Your time has not yet come..  ", he
utters.

Top of the Cliff~

moments just turning around, taking in all that you see.  To the south and east
you see the forest sweeping outwards from the cliff wall, and to the north you
see a clearing surrounding a small town.

The Catacombs~
   You walk along the passage, and notice the remains of all the previous kings
of Graye are buried on either side of you.  You can see in the room, but there
is no discernable source of light.  The passage continues on to the north and
south.
