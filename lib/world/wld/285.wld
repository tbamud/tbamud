And no...you don't get a trial.  You don't deserve one.  The courtroom is
filled with spectators and jury members.  They seem to have no real reason to
be here since there isn't going to be a trial.  They jeer and boo you as you
stand in the middle of the courtroom.  To the north are the Halls of Judgement.

you know you are in Hell....  Everything in this office seems to be made of
snakeskin.  This is the only lawyer's office in hell, so if you don't like them
you're out of luck.  But then again...if you are in hell...you must've run out
of luck a while ago.  To the east is the Office of Complaints.  To the south

to hell to serve the public for eternity.  He will buy almost anything you have,
since business is slow.  Not many people visit Hell.  The store is filled with
worthless junk.  Piles of aluminum balls and bottle cap collections fill the
corners of the room.  Things of every description lie about the store.  To the

are recognizable and some are not.  Rumor has it that Stanley made a deal with a
devil...so I guess his lease is up in seven years...  A courtyard is to the
