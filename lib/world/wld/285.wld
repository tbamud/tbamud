Halls of Judgement~
   You are standing in the Halls of Judgement.  There are many alcoves which
contain different methods of torture, each more grotesque than the one before
it.  On the wall a plaque reads, 'If you are here...You are Guilty...You
have been judged...sound fair?  Too bad...'  The hall continues to the east.
The Courtroom is to the south.

And no...you don't get a trial.  You don't deserve one.  The courtroom is
filled with spectators and jury members.  They seem to have no real reason to
be here since there isn't going to be a trial.  They jeer and boo you as you
stand in the middle of the courtroom.  To the north are the Halls of Judgement.

Lawyer's Office~
   As you look around you, you realize you've entered a lawyer's office.  Now
you know you are in Hell....  Everything in this office seems to be made of
snakeskin.  This is the only lawyer's office in hell, so if you don't like them
you're out of luck.  But then again...if you are in hell...you must've run out
of luck a while ago.  To the east is the Office of Complaints.  To the south

to hell to serve the public for eternity.  He will buy almost anything you have,
since business is slow.  Not many people visit Hell.  The store is filled with
worthless junk.  Piles of aluminum balls and bottle cap collections fill the
corners of the room.  Things of every description lie about the store.  To the

are recognizable and some are not.  Rumor has it that Stanley made a deal with a
