South Pass Area Description Room (Crysanthia)~
   The South Pass is where the great southern mountain range, dominating most
of the eastern part of where the coastline meets the desert.  Few who venture
into the south pass has lived to tell about it, so it is with some jest people
say If you don't behave The Drow from south Pass will come get you.  The few
who actually know what is going on here, frow upon this saying, as they know
very well that the south pass is full of all kinds of caves.  Some leading no
where, some inhabited by hideous monsters.  And others leading so far into the
heart of the mountains that you might actually unwarily stumble upon the
inhabitants of the underdark.  It is rumored that if you should wish to access
the cities of the drow, or to slay mindflayers, this is your direct route to
the underdark.  Some speculate there might be other ways to get there aswell,
but it has never been proven.

Southern Desert~
   The sands in the desert swirl around and the hot sun beats upon the lands.
To the south can be seen some hills.  North is nothing but desert, sand, sun
and heat.  To the west can be seen some kragla birds waiting for something to
die so that they may finally have a meal.  Eastward dunes of sand expand as far
as the eye can see.

   The desert has it's own unappreciated beauty.  It is full of every hue of

Sloping Slate Hills~
   The rutted path meanders upward made of broken slate with sharp cutting
edges that tear at the soles of ones boots.  One can feel the heat of the
desert, the sun pounding down upon them incessantly.  To the north the hills
slope down to the Southern Desert.  East and west the hills are very similar to
those which are trodded here.  Climbing these slopes is tedious and tiring on
the body, mind and soul.  Many adventurers have lost hope here of finding the
path to the city of NewHaven.

~
E
southern mountains~
   The great range of the Southern Mountains is to the south.  It is one of the
smaller ranges of mountains in the area but has some of the highest peaks in
the world.  They consist mostly of purple granite rock and were formed when the
plates of the world collided together during the 'Great Formation' and were
pushed up out of the bowels of the ground and left here asunder.  Many legends
of NewHaven dwarves, drow demons, caves with riches and great battles with
dragons, orcs, elephants, and horses abound the land but they have been called
'old wives tales' and dubious to the truth of such tales.

Low End of a Path~
   Here begins a rutted path.  Piles of rock and slate on the sides are the
only markings to distinguish it from the rest of the hills.  It has been ages
since anything but birds of prey and rodents have traveled to this point.  The
path leads down from the hills of the Southern Mountains to the north towards
the Southern Desert.  It appears as if this faint trail may turn into a path
that actually goes someplace.

Great Southern Desert~
   The sands of the desert are older than time itself.  Hot desert winds cause
the sand to fly and gather into dunes at every obstacle, making the desert look
like an enormous golden sea.  The desert stretches far to the north, east and
west, while to the south can be seen the hills and summits, marking the beginning
of the Southern Mountains.  One can continue their travels to the east and west
where the dunes are far enough apart to provide a path.

An Ascending Trail~
   The path slopes steeply and narrows with slippery slate chunks and pieces of
purple granite in the trail.  It has been a long time since anyone has traveled
on this path so some spots are cluttered with boulders of granite partially
blocking it and other parts have wind hewn ruts that look like they were cut by
some insane sculptor who was mad at the world.

A Turn in the Trail~
   The path takes a southwesterly course here and is strewn with boulders of
various sizes from avalanches ages ago.  This part of the trail appears to
be about halfway up the Southern Mountains and it gets steeper to the south as
it travels further along the Southern Mountains.  Upwards you can barely make out
some sort of ledge.  Slightly upward and to the west is a narrow crumbling path
that looks too risky to attempt to traverse.

around.  North, over the ledge, the vastness of the desert spans below and
every now and then there is some movement in the shifting dunes of sand.
Barely visible, the peak of the mountain, which is still quite a way upward

starts again a ways off to the east near a huge tree.  Below is the sheer side

A Secret Entrance to the Cavern~
   The path stops at a dwarven carved door to the secret path to NewHaven.
It looks brand new, probably because the dwarven stone cutters cast spells on
it to preserve it centuries ago.  Downward, one can barely make out the stone
road to the city within the mountain.  It is puzzling where this door comes
from and to where it leads.  Only a brave explorer would be able to find out.
A cautious and conservative explorer would return from whence he came and never

always more interesting than what was seen behind.  There are intricately
carved statues of long forgotten noble dwarven kings along the road every few
strata.  The stone bricks are of the finest quality, made to last many
centuries and hardly worn.  Who could have crafted such work?  It was made with
long forgotten arts and spells.  Ancient lore states that it could only have
been fabricated by the NewHaven dwarves of old.  To the east is a mountain of
some type within the immense cavern.  Up, the road seems to end at a mysterious
runed door.

a mountain of bones here.  The dragon corpse is surrounded by thousands of
skeletons of brave dwarven warriors still clad in burnt and partially melted
armor.  Scattered here and there are smaller skeletons of orcs, wolves, giant
eagles, elephants and horses.  How could this have happened?  It looks like
time was frozen at the end of a battle that no one won.  Was it a force of
nature, some great act of the gods, the evil magic of a sorcerer or mage, or
perhaps there are some survivors someplace, refugees that ran away and
disappeared to some unknown land, unable to return to claim victory and clean
up the battlefield.  To the west is a wide road of some type.  To the east is a
broken bridge across a bottomless chasm.

   Here lies the epitome of dwarven architecture destroyed and laying in ruins.
It is a magnificent suspension bridge arching across a bottomless chasm.
However the distal side is broken and what remains of it is hanging down the
chasm in a twisted menagerie of cable, stone, mithril, and gold.  The proximal
side has somehow remained suspended on the west side, but droops down
precariously and could tumble into the chasm at any moment.  To the west there
is a large gray and black heap.  You notice a pile of rubble on the proximal
side which doesn't seem to fit there.  The rubble consist of hides, sticks,
tree trunks, and bones of small animals.  To the north the path delves down

ages ago but the branches still grow and are teeming with small animals of all
types.  There is a sturdy ladder going up and down the tree trunk.  Another
branch goes from the trunk of the tree to the east.

The Roots of the Tree~
   Inside the eroded crack in the ground one can see the roots of the ponderosa
pine.  The heart of the tree from which life sustaining minerals and water are
drawn from the soil.  They go deep into the side of the mountain and have
supported the tree for centuries.  Long fingers of the hand of the tree
grasping the earth with a tight grip in the ground upon which it stands.
Often their importance and beauty are forgotten by the land walkers above, but
never by the tree itself, for if not for the roots below there would be nothing
above.

story newhaven~
   The root of the tree laments it's story to you of the Legend of NewHaven.
Greetings Adventurer I am the sole survior of the battle of the fall of
NewHaven.  It was in the reign of the Dwarven King Elcnir in the year of
Goldleaf.  The NewHaven Dwarves, Men of Adonma, Elephants of Glad, Ents of
Drenwood, and Eagles of Pratat fought valiantly against the Armies of Floth the
Silver Sorceror and his armies of wolves, orcs, Urukhai and the Dragon of Hoth
at the pit of the crack in the world.  The battle lasted for 5 days and on the
5th day the "Myst of the crack" came forth from the depths of the chasm,
disturbed from it's deep slumber and with a terrible wrath on the clashing
armies in the battlefield, destroyed them all instantly in their tracks.  I
was on this perimeter and my trunk and roots were petrified by the "Myst of the
crack" and have stood here alone since.  Now all I have is the company of birds
and small creatures in my bough and I am unable to walk back to my forest of
Drenwood and my heart grows weary and homesick.

A Turn in the Path~
   Here the path curves around the side of the mountain in a slight slope.  It
seems to have been skillfully carved out of the rock with the great
craftmanship, only mastered by the NewHaven dwarves.  Ones feet bounce lightly
on the trail and don't tire as easily for some reason, perhaps the road has
been woven with magical spells of travelling, like they were in the days of
old.  North the path continues up the trail towards the mountain peak.  Down
the gently winding road makes it's way to the foothills of the mountains.

A Path Up the Mountain~
   The path continues up the moutain in a gentle slope with an easy climb.
Some wild mountain flowers grow along the path.  A few rotting trees lie broken
and decaying around you.  There are many patches of small trees sprouting up
all around the old and decaying ones as nature regenerates itself.  Up there is
a turn in the path.  West the path slowly dwindles into a lightly wooded area.

   The faint trail slopes upward in a serpentine fashion thru a light wooded

cushion ones steps.  Birds chirp, squirrels chatter, rabbits scamper about and
and an occasional deer can be seen grazing on the new grass and bark they can
find as they forage for food.  East the path seems to widen and is paved with

important or do they have enough supplies for their journey.  East the path

   The path is hewn out of the rock on the south side of the chasm.  Below is a
seemingly bottomless pit with some volcanic type fumes drifting up from within.
The path is roughly hewn and not of dwarven construction but seems sturdy
enough.  Every few strata there is a stairwell that winds up and down the
chasm.  Periodically a loose rock or boulder dislodges from the side of the
chasm and crashes below on the sides of the chasm walls resounding for a few
minutes then no sounds can be heard as it's course takes it from the sides.

air, no food , no water, or other substanance to sustain life.  Yet, sounds of
soft footsteps can be heard coming from all around.

Another Part of the Cave~
   The cave has dark walls, stale air, strange sounds of footsteps coming from
all around.  The walls are a conglomerate of adamite and obsidian rock and an
evil force seems to raditate from them.  The floor has been hewn smooth by
someone and seems to have no signs of wear.

Another Part of the Cave~
   Stale air, odors of death and decay, cool and dry blanket the darkness of
the cavern here.  If someone were to get lost here they would surely die for
lack of food, water, fresh air, light or hope of finding a path thru the dark
caverns, niches, slopes.  The floor is smooth here but the walls are sharp to
the touch with shards of obsidian, adamite protruding from it.  Soft pattering
sounds can be heard echoing off the walls from all around.

Another Part of the Cave~
   This part of the cave is very similar to the others.  Dark obsidian rocks
jut out from the sides with glimmers of adamite cyrstal shards wedged in
between the layers.  If one were to get lost here they would surely die, no
food, water, light or fresh air to sustain them for very long.  Soft patting
footsteps can be heard coming from somewhere within to the south.

Obsidian Hallway~
   An obsidian hallway is smooth on all sides.  It is straight and narrow and
runs north and south.  There is a dark obsidian door on the north side.  An
opening to a dark cavern is on the south.  Soft pattering sounds can be heard
towards the south but inside the the hallway there are no sounds.  The sounds
and light seem to be absorbed by the mysterious stone the walls, ceiling, and
floor are made of.

A Dark Hallway~
   The hallway has smooth dark black walls of obsidan blocks, the floor has
obsidan and onyx tile fashioned into a spiderweb design.  There are no sounds,
no smells the air is fresh but still.  The ceiling emits a soft red glow from
the tiles arranged into a spiderweb moasaic.  There are a few doors on the
walls along the passage way and sharp turns along it's path.  The craftmanship
of the tiles and blocks of the walls are superb and no cracks can be detected
between the smooth grotesque design.  The dim red glow seems to be absorbed by
the black walls and the onyx tiles on the floor glimmer reflections from the
ceiling so only a short distance can be seen down the hallway.

The Outer Chamber~
   This room has no floor, ceiling, or walls.  There are strong strands of
spider web approching a central zone.  The strands are about 20 metrons long
and 8 cm thick.  If one fell off a supporting strand, they would not fall too
far before landing on another.  The strands are symetrically designed and
radiate from the central chamber within the zone.  One can barely make out
another chamber directly in the center which is suspended in space by the
thousands of strands of spiderweb supporting it.

South Pass Links Room {Crysanthia]~
   This zone links north to room 9030.  Build all rooms south of that
connection point.
Best link to zone 90 would be south to room 23904 and north from
23904 to room 9030 in zone 90. When implemented on CW this
should be edited in both rooms on other port.
