A paved path~
   You are standing at the edge of the city.  From here, a short,
paved path leads toward the east.  To the northeast is a large building,
its yard lined by an old fence of stone.

   This is a modest zone with about 65 rooms.  It is a little forest,
maybe east of Midgaard.  The area was originally written for low-level
(say 1-10) players.

Before a small gate~
   The paving turns toward the north, where stands a wooden gate at
the fence.  A sign has been fastened on the gate, reading "Galeaufir's
Tavern".  A brown path leads to the east, toward light forest.

   You are standing on a low and barren hill.  There are several foot-
prints on it.  There is a small grove to the north.

A small grove~
   You are standing at a peaceful grove, surrounded by those
evergrowing trees and various flowers which all look so beautiful,
but also somewhat sad.
   There is a large ant hill, and as a contrast to the grove it
nearly swarms life.  A faint track leads to the north, and to the
west there lies a ditch.

A grassy ditch~

Low bushes grow around.  The ditch leads west, while there is a grove to
the east.

south you can see a grassy hillside, on where a narrow path descends.

Through some bushes~
   You are struggling at a thicket, disturbed by several multicolorous
spiders and gadflies.  Most of these bushes are unusually tough, lashing
your face with an unpleasant force.  There is a small ditch to the south.

Walking on the trunk~
   You move forward, keeping your balance quite easily since the trunk
is so broad.  It seems that many smaller trees remained under when this
giant overturned years ago.
   Now, there lies the rhizome.  The roots appear to give passage to
the south.

A narrow path~
   You step on a narrow path, engraved deep in the ground.  Several
stones make your walking quite difficult, and you are worried about
your feet.  The foliages form a green and inpenetrable "wall" around
the path which seems to descend to the east.

an ancient trench.  Tremendous, gnarled roots from some brown and black
arches above.  The path leads both to the west and east.

An ancient crater~
   You find yourself standing at a vast and deep pit, obviously an
ancient crater with a diameter of 30 metres, at least.  The bottom is
covered in brownish grass and there are several rough boulders around,
most of them black.  Also you notice that the crater is full of small
folk, everyone directing towards a structure of some kind further away
to the east.

At the crater~
   With the brownies you start approaching the structure as well.
It looks like a wooden dais, on where a couple of beings are sitting,
deep in their discussion.  Behind them there stands what could be a
totem or a statue of some kind.  Yet you do not know what this all is
about, but no doubt this place must be of great importance and sanctity
for these people.

The Ceremony Plateau~
   The dais has been grinded very smooth.  Four green pictures cover
its surface, representing fine trees.  Each picture points to the sepa-
rate cardinal direction.  In the middle of the dais stands a tall, wooden
statue, resembling an impressive woman, clad in clothes made of large
leaves and garments.
   The brownies assemble to the foot of the dais and you feel the
atmosphere running high.

statue woman~
   The statue is of light wood and appears very skillfully carved.  The woman it
presents has a tall lenght of straight hair almost reaching her legs.  Worn on
her head is a crown made of the most beautiful flowers, barely found in every
forest.  Couple of small birds are sitting on her shoulders, seemingly listening
earnestly.  This must be the Queen of the forest herself.
