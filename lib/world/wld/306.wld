Lower Trunk of the Great Tree~
   The base of the Great Tree lies below, the newbie area just a short jump
from the trunk upon which you precariously cling.  Up above are the many
branchings of the Great Tree, the system of branches making a vweritable
highway in the sky where movement can be seen from the many creatures which
inhabit the tree even from here.  A hole in the trunk opens up into the tree
northward, a small home visible inside.

On the Trunk at the Lower Branch System~
   The tree's branches open out wide and full over the entire newbie area,
making it possible to wander about the tree limbs, looking down upon Dibrova's
world.  The way down to the main Newbie Area lies just below, a steady climb
upward is also possible.  Branches lead out in every direction.

On the Trunk at the Upper Branch System~
   This is as far up as is safely possible within the Great Tree.  The trunk
above this point is not strong enough to hold any substantial weight.
Branches lead off in every direction, the upper branch system still just as
strong as the branches below.

Inside the Trunk~
   This inner trunk has been carved out and made into a cozy little home
complete with a lounge chair and small bed made from twigs and leaves.
Another small chamber is connected to the north through a short archway.

the tree in which it resides.  Only the most foolish would attempt to defy a

Traveling the Inner Branches~
   These are the strongest of the upper branches, easily as thick as a giant's
armspan.  Still, even with the strength of the Tree's trunk so close and the
thickness of the branches themselves, they sway alarmingly with the wind.

The Outer Branches~
   The top of the Great Tree is a beautiful, stunning panorama of views and
vistas which look out over the entire world in all its splendor.  A slow wind
blows by, ruffling the leaves all around, causing the branches to sway ever so
slightly.

The Outer Branches~
   The steady swaying of the Tree from the winds which buffet it at this
altitude is strangely pacific, a very nonassuming sway which is absolutely no
cause for alarm.  Branches of the Tree lie in every direction.

   This is the absolute limit of the Tree's reach in both height and direction.
The only way to go is back toward the trunk.

   The drop down below is a bit further than would be comfortable, bit in
glancing up higher it is seen that there is still more height to be attained.
The only direction to travel is back along a branch to the east.
