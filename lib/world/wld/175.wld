Notes        : This is not an easy zone. The riddles are very tough and I doubt
               many people will be able to complete them. So the prize should
               be worthwhile. I'm sure the word will get out as soon as someone
               guesses them though.

A Gravel Path~
   The path beneath you is made of loose gravel, and travels both north and
east.  To the north a large complex is visible, with a tower peaking into the
sky to the northwest.  To the south lies a granite castle.

A Dead End~
   The path halts suddenly here at the base of what at first glance looks like
a cliff.  But upon closer examination, the cliff is revealed to be part of a
wall that extends to the east and west as far as the eye can see.

is a finely constructed door here, designed to merge seamlessly into the
northern wall.

The Wizard's Mansion~
   You are in a richly decorated room, with thick carpet under your feet and
tapestries hanging from the walls.  To the west lies a staircase, and to the
east you can hear the gurgling of water.  On the north wall hangs a curious
quicksilver mirror.

An Indoor River~
   The carpet here comes to an abrupt halt as some hidden mechanism pumps
water into the hallway and sends it flowing to the east, where it quickly
becomes rapid and hostile.  On the north wall is a large tapestry, which
appears suspiciously door-like.

The brilliant tapestry is a rich and colorful depiction of a violent clash of four armies, each led by it's own Wizardly commander. It is so realistic, it could almost be moving.
It is also suspiciously door-shaped.

   You are in a tight space behind a tapestry.  It is cramped, cold, dark, and
smells of moist, moldy stone.  The only thing of intrest is an inscription on

to make your way back upstream.  The brick walls around you become coarse and

However, the banks of the river are too steep to climb, and you are forced
along a tight bend to the east.

   You are surrounded by a shimmering white light in all directions but down.
Beneath you, water laps gently through the void of brightness, and to the south
you hear the sounds of a lake.  To the west, you can hear the muffled bickering
of two guards.

The Guardian Room~
   But for the four exits, this room is completly and utterly bare.  In each of
the four cardinal directions lies a door, and only the northern is even
remotely earthly in appearance.  The west wall has a carved obsidian doorframe
attached, pure blackness inside.  The east is the inverse of the first, a
carved ivory frame with glowing white light.  The south has a gray stone frame,
and liquid quicksilver ripples gently on the surface.

occasional blood red splash of a rug or a tapestry.  There is a desk to the west

Outside~
   The porthole at your feet is surrounded as far as the eye can see by a vast
desert in the grips of eternal night.  The stars and moon provide enough light
to see by.  Before you lies a rock carved with what looks like crude poetry.
You see no reason to explore the desert.  It's absolutely empty as far as the
eye can see, and probably further.
