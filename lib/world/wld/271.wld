The Sunken Temple Courtyard~
   The pale light from the open sky pours always into this unsheltered
courtyard, together with the amber glow of standing torches.  Many citizens of
the town of Sundhaven find it their pleasure to lounge here.  The dark marble
temple rises like a shadow to the north, the vivid colors of roses eastwards,
and the library lies to the west.  There is a stone arch to the south.

The Temple of Mercy~
   A myriad of candles, burning brightly in amber hues, illuminate the
black-domed temple.  This is where all adventurers of human ilk must begin
their trials of danger and discovery.  You stand in a cast of rosy-gold light,
stretching along the floor from a stained glass window that serves as your
first sight of the known world.  The unknown world awaits you with open..
Jaws.  There is an inscription in the north wall.

inscription~
   The inscription reads: I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said -
"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert...  Near them, on the
sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and
sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet
survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the
heart that fed.  And on the pedestal, these words appear: I am the Fallen King,
Kings of Kings, Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  Nothing beside
remains.  Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, The lone
and level sands stretch far away.  "

The alms room~
   Murals of black and gold adorn the walls in swirling patterns, within which
are outlined several dark silhouettes.  Under some scrutiny you can trace a
basilisk, a chimera, and a dragon circling a deity, a dusty red cloak about her
neck.  Homage and sacrifice to this human deity are paid here by the other
citizens of the realm.

A narrow terrace north of the temple~
   You stand on a thin stone terrace before the temple.  Southwards the dome of
the temple rises among the town smoke, and a set of steps to the north leads up
to the northern square before the cliffs edge.  Black willows grow in small
clusters to the east and west.

Sundhaven square~
   The traffic of foreigners and local citizens is heavy here, the ground is
trodden down and the scents of animals, smoke and exotic perfumes hangs in the
air.  The cliffs and the northern gate of the town lie north of here, the lane
paralleling the cliffs runs east and west, and the entrance to the temple is
southwards.

The gate at the cliffs~
   The wind picks up and blows sharply at your hair and garb as the town falls
behind and the world opens out before you.  You are standing atop a highland
cliff, lined with mosses, lichen and purple heather, and looking out over a
foggy wetland.  The graveyard for the dead of Sundhaven lies near the foot of
the cliffs, and in the far distance you can make out the blue line of the sea
closing the horizon.

small shop.  On a window in the north wall sits a bizarre golden squid-like
creature in a jar, glinting in the sun.  You wonder what oddities could be
found in storage.

gate; a shaded lane travels to the south.

purple-flowering wisteria vine, forming in leafy clumps at the bottoms.  The
park is a quiet, relaxing place, with the exception of the occasional explosion
coming from a pale tower rising to the northwest, accompanied by a brilliant
flash of light.

to the north startles you, and piques your curiosity about that strange place.

The Tower of Sorcery~
   Gently curving sigils have been worked into the ancient, weathered stone of
the tower of the local wizards, winding towards the ceiling in a sloping
spiral.  A stairwell has its foot at the north wall, rickety but presumably
stable enough to support you.  A dim violet faerie glow illuminates the room.

walls of the darkened stairwell.  At each turn in the spiral steps a more
mangled face than the last confronts you, drawing closer to the laboratory
above.  What is the sculptor implying about the study of magic?

The mages' laboratory~
   **BOOM!  ** When your vision returns to normal, you find yourself surrounded
by narrow black lab tables cluttered with a chaotic mess of bubbling vials,
shattered beakers, and miscellaneous spell components.  The latest experiment
in familiars, a leathery-skinned fork-tailed creature, hops knavishly from
shoulder to shoulder among the mages at work here.  If you need practice in the
magic arts, this would be a good place to start.

At the gallows~
   In the shade of old gnarl-limbed elder trees stands the bane of all thieves
and murderers, the platform of the gallows.  The dark sand of the road shows
none of the blood that has been shed here, but the legends of the dead live on
in tales and nightmares.  The executions still take place at irregular
intervals, to the joy of hidden enemies and law-abiding citizens.  You note
there is plenty of room for spectators.  Besides the east-west road, a stone
arch stands to the north, and a well-travelled path leads southwards.

ivy-clothed building to the east.

secret themselves away in hideouts by day.  The place is well-known to be run
by the local assassins guild, and it is common to witness conversations here
spoken in whispers as deals are cut and bounties arranged.  The rules of

The shanties and town dump add a mild stench to the air, and attest to the
virtual burglaries of the poor by the rich..  And often by the poor.

you in slightly with each step.  A rotten stench is filtering in from the west,
repelling you in another direction automatically such that it takes a great
conscious effort for you to turn that way.  The path heads north into the
town's mainstream, and south closer to the wildlands beyond it.

The butcher shop~
   You are enclosed in a poorly lit, stuffy room that smells of blood, salted
meat and strange preservatives you didn't think existed in this time period.
Pewter cases filled with ice give off wisps of steam near a roasting fire at
the east wall.  You might wonder why this place is situated so proximate to the
gallows, but the butcher nonchalantly claims all his goods died peaceably, then
turns away to stifle a chuckle.

The stables~
   No whinnies issue from the darkened stalls of this place; the horses are as
yet untamed and the stables lie empty.  It is not unusual for a vagrant to make
his home here, however, before being moved on by the guards or attacked by the
barn owls.

The east gate of Sundhaven~
   You stand on the eastern border of Sundhaven, before a heavy gate forged
from iron and painted bone-white.  A hot desert wind blows through the grating
sporadically, giving hint to the vast regions beyond.

The west gate of Sundhaven~
   An ornate gate, heavy and wrought from black iron, hangs on ancient hinges
to the west, bordered by slender elms.  The ivy so plentiful in the town is
twined and braided about its intricate coils and carvings, which consist
largely of prowling cats and eclipsed circle designs.

The Dirk & Dagger~
   A circular stone is whirring in a fast spin at the far wall, as the
weaponsmaster of Sundhaven continually sharpens his wares, and re-hangs them to
display on the stone and mortar walls.  A single window admits virtually no
light, so filled with the webs and dust of neglect is it..  Obviously the
shopowner prefers to seclude himself to the obsessive labors of his work.  You
wonder if he ever makes anything new, so fanatical he is about sharpening and
re-sharpening the old.

The Silver Scale~
   You pass into a shop whose walls are gleaming dully, hung with various armor
reflecting the firelight spawning from the forge.  Goods of defensive metal may
be bought and sold here, at nearly reasonable prices.  Use 'list' to peruse the
options.

Dragon's Wrath Alehouse~
   You have entered a rowdy tavern, noticeably different from the intellectual
bounty hunting atmosphere of the Nightbreak Cafe.  Your feet are hard put to
find a purchase on the slippery floor of spilled ale and cracked, sodden wood.
This is the meeting place of those of a fighting bent, accordingly the blood
from last night's brawls has barely dried on the walls before tonight's is
shed, be wary.

Along the bar counter~
   You have entered a loud and boisterous corner in the alehouse, where
adventurers tell their tales of fact and fable..  Perhaps there are things to
be learned here of the lands beyond the thin walls of the city.

Mekala's Thai Kitchen~
   A large room crowded with ornamental porcelain elephants, incense dishes and
silkscreen dividers encloses you, the blur of spicy scents from the kitchen
bringing a flush of red to your face.  A steep, narrow stairwell rises up the
east wall.

The rooftop at Mekala's~
   The open, moist air gives some relief from the heat below.  Wild birds
circle about above your head, curious about the food but too shy to descend.
A few tables stand adorned with simple white tablecloths and red candles.

The sparring hall~
   Shields and other items of heraldry line the sunken stone walls of the
sparring room, gleaming with human pride.  While not being overly promiscuous,
the heads of foes are noticeably stacked one atop the other on a pole of
polished wood in the corner.  If you are looking to improve your skills in the
art of battle, this might be a good place to start.

The Bread Basket~
   You pass into an unusually humble dwelling and shop for the town, built from
baked clay and hot from the cumbersome bread ovens projecting partially out of
the far wall.  The smell of fresh bread is mouth-watering.

   The orange glow of the forge brightens an otherwise black, windowless room.
This is the blacksmith's home and workplace; a humble cot rests very close to
the fire.

The aviary~
   Shrill and murmuring bird calls alike assail your ears.  The aviary is
crowded with bird cages holding the trained variety of species for sale, and
something like aspirin is available on a small, high-standing round table by
the door.

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   Make two rooms and some pets.  The rooms MUST be sequential.  If the first
room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.

The post office~
   You narrowly avoid the guillotine-style slash of a rusted axe as you pass
through the doorway of the town post office.  It seems some sort of riot is
underway in here - what would be a strike if this wasn't before unions - among
the numerous disgruntled postal workers conglomerated.  Shining silver letter-
openers flash in the light as they heedlessly try to backstab anyone in sight.
It's a droll scene.  You decide it prudent to mail your wares and be on your
way.  There is a sign posted on the north wall.

Standing at the brink~
   A sea of light, floating fog opens up before you, swallowing most of the
cliff and the lands beyond in its pale jaws.  Far beyond the whiteness opens
out to reveal a welcome azure that is the mantle of the sea.  A trail
disappears downwards into the mist.

A balcony of the tower~
   This high point on the northern edge of Sundhaven boasts quite a view.
When fog is not seen rolling about the balcony's railing, one can see the
graveyard near the foot of the cliff to the north, and beyond it, the pearl
blue sea, clothing the far horizon.  The mages have made this a favored place
for recreational studies.

A silvery-lit landing~
   Your steps echo in a hollow stairwell of naked stone.  The air hangs light
and silent about you as a curtain of falling snow, though there is a chanting
taking place, seemingly miles away, in the chamber to the west.  Lamps mounted
on the walls give off a silver glow reminiscent of saints and martyrs, whether
they died for the cause of good, or for evil.

The room of doctrine~
   Artifacts and relics from a time before the known world are encased and
illumined in airless, black glass cabinets, their twinkling golden and silver
chasings catching your eye with mocking immortality.  Urns of demon ash line
polished amberwood shelves, and a small, simple altar edged in ivory stands
against the north wall.  This is the sanctum of the ministry.  Those of a pious
bent would do well to begin studies here.

The chamber of sacrifice~
   You have entered a somber chamber, somehow filled with darkness and still
retaining shadows that seem to flicker in the recesses of the room.  It appears
a sacrifice to the matron deity of Sundhaven is scheduled to take place.  You
may watch, but be warned there are times set aside for the sacrifice of those
who interfere.

At a swinging wooden gate~
   You pass through a creaking gate of weathered wood, swinging idly in the
wind.  To the west rise the bluffs and gardens of the homes of Sundhaven's
varied people; citizens can also be seen passing eastwards into the town
itself.

you bluffs rise, pale gray and dark sandstone, smooth from the sculpturing of
winds, and dotted with purple heather and green mosses.  A path strays through
the clifftop hills.
