Outside the Wayhouse~
   You are outside a large, two-story building which proports to be 'Werith's
Wayhouse' on a brightly lettered sign out front.  You hear laughing and revelry
from inside -- sounds like a lively place.  The main doors are directly south
of you, and small paths lead east and west around the building.  Eastward is
another smaller building; obviously a stable.  Northward is the main road,
providing all the traffic and customers for this establishment.

   Werith's Wayhouse by Builder_5
Copyright 1993 by Curious Areas Workshop
*
'Werith's Wayhouse' is a high-mob population area, with 40 rooms, 19
different types of mobs and objects.  It was meant to be placed
somewhere between two widely used towns as a rest stop area. We hope
you like it.
*
#00 -- add entrance/exit to the north.
The north exit is #00.
A receptionist can be added to the upstairs area: around #30 would
probably be the best area.
Mob ##04 should have the standard spellcaster routine.
*
Credits
A Big Thanks to Builder_5 for supporting C.A.W. Also, kudos to Tarkin
of VieMud (viemud.org 4000) for allowing us to use his mud for
pre-release testing. This area was built with the aid of George
Essl's Dikued program.  We would like to thank Mr. Essl for his time
and determination to create and support Dikued. The following people
have aided C.A.W. and Builder_5 in numerous ways, and all receive our
deepest gratitude: Shane Finkel, Josh 'Champion of Bagels' Megerman,
John D. Horner, and the System Adminstrators of ODU

Near a Large Building~
   You are north-west of the Wayhouse.  This section of the path seems less
used, possibly because there's nothing really over here.  The trees crowd in
towards the clearing, making the general area seem rather eerie somehow.  The
voices coming from inside are clearly audible, and by listening hard you can
almost make out the words.  The path around the building continues to the west
and south.

Near a Large Building~
   You are standing on the path that runs around the Wayhouse to the west.  A
window spills light onto the trees that block out all available light overhead.
You hear general merryment and alcoholism from inside, and wonder if being
inside would be more fun than walking around outside...

   You are south-west of the main structure of the Wayhouse.  A lone rain
barrel catches run-off from the roof eaves by the corner of the building, and
you spy a small white fence cordoning off an herb garden nearby.  The path
around the building leads to the north and east.

Outside the Wayhouse~
   You are standing just south of Werith's Wayhouse, right where the kitchen
entrance is.  A well trodden path leads east, towards a small shack that is
unmistakeably an outhouse.  You hear the unmistakeable sound of clanging pots
and pans from the inside, the warning of an upcoming meal.  The path around the
building here runs east, and west.

   The Wayhouse is just north-west of you here, and you are right by the
facility's outhouse to the south.  The wooden planks of the stable form an
alley to the north, with the path leading right in-between.  Westwards is the
kitchen entrance to the Wayhouse, kept wide open to let the heat inside escape.

the west, and the wooden planked walls of the stable to the east.  The path

south, between the two buildings, towards what appears to be an outhouse.

Just Outside the Stable~
   The stable of the Wayhouse is just south of you, its wooden doors spread
open and inviting.  Inside you can hear the snorting of horses, and the
occasional hoof scraping against the ground.  The path leads to the west,
towards the Wayhouse.

Inside the Stable~
   You are standing inside the dusty confines of the stable.  Stalls line the
aisle, some with horses, some empty.  A pail filled with water and a stack of
grain are heaped up against the interior wall, dimly illuminated by a lantern
hanging from a rafter.  Seems rather quiet in here...

   The bar runs south here all along the western wall.  A few smaller tables
here are set up with various board games, ready to play.  There's also a shelf
along the wall, lined with a few popular books; light reading all of them.
The patrons here seem to be a bit quieter than the rowdy bunch in the rest of
the building.

Main Room~
   A window here offers a view outside, where it doesn't seem near as social as
it is inside.  Tables filled with laughing customers eat and drink and
generally be merry, not caring what the weather is like, and probably not even
knowing.  There's a general sense of joy in the room; the joy of still being
alive in such a dangerous world as this one.  For a moment, you feel like
joining them...

Main Room~
   You stand just inside the Main Room of Werith's Wayhouse.  The whole place
stretches out all around you, a conglomeration of people, food, and alcohol.
The sheer chatter and roar of conversation makes your ears hurt a little, and
then you suddenly notice you're smiling.  Yes, this place might do for
awhile...

Main Room~
   The giant fireplace here sends a great amount of heat throughout the room.
The sheer massiveness of the stone edifice and the literal bonfire inside makes
you give the area a clear way.  A few of the older and less human residents of
the inn seem to be enjoying these tables, however.

   Several dart boards line the wall to the south, and darts are scattered all
about on the tables and stuck in the wall.  The people coming up and down the
stairs to the east carefully walk by the wall to avoid being pin-cushioned
involuntarily, and you think it would be a good idea to do the same.

   The tables seem to thin out around here, to give room for the traffic going
in and out of the kitchen through the archway to the south.  Waiters and
waitresses march in and out with empty plates and sumptuous platters, hardly
stopping to breathe in their business.  You hear the distant clank of a pot
banging against something -- the chefs are busy too it seems.  Your stomach
growls...  Are you hungry at all?

Main Room~
   This seems to be a central part of the room, where many people congregate to
talk or sing or dance or whatever they feel like at that exact moment.  The
people seem just on the edge of being completely carried away at every moment,
and you wonder if it would be beneath your dignity to join them.

   The wooden bar runs along the length of the western wall, just in front of
the many shelves of different colored alcohol in different shaped bottles.
You espy drunkards and waitresses, adventurers and farmers althroughout the
building from this vantage point, and guess that this establishment is turning
a pretty penny in profits.  Nice.

   The bar continues along the length of the western wall.  An empty bottle
with some spare coppers in it lies on top of its polished surface; tip
collection evidently.  The tables nearby seem mostly filled with people and
food, the bar appears at times to be either packed, or merely elbow-to- elbow.
A lantern hanging from a rafter overhead casts shadows among the beerstains on
the floor and gives the complexion of everyone around a sort of glow.  You
feel...  Comfortable here.

Main Room~
   In the clutter of the main room of the Wayhouse, is a path leading out from
the kitchen to the east.  A wide archway allows admittance to the back room,
from which you hear the distant clank of a pan hitting another.  There aren't
very many tables here, due to the amount of traffic coming in and out.

   This is the main entranceway of the kitchen.  Two archways serve as an entry
and exit point from the main room of the wayhouse, one north, one west.  The
kitchen is a room roughly thirty feet by thirty feet, extending from the south
and east from here.  You see many pots on the stove bubbling away and hear the
whistle of a kettle somewhere off to the left...  Business must be good.

Kitchen~
   You are standing in a more quiet area of the kitchen, where various supplies
of flour, grain and meats are kept.  The kitchen extends south and west from
here; that's where the main clutter seems to be.  A steady thump-thump-thump
from the north wall reminds you that the main room is where are the fun and
action seems to be...

Kitchen~
   The south-eastern section of the kitchen here is a veritable whirlwind of
activity!  The entire area is comprised of cooking surfaces and ovens; enough
to keep a massive amount of food ready at any one time.  The aisles are large,
allowing room for frantic chefs and waiters to hurtle through the kitchen with
only a small amount of collisions.  Seems hectic, yet efficient.  The rest of
the kitchen is to the north and west from here.

   This is the back entranceway to the kitchen, where the door is kept
seasonally open to allow the hot air to escape.  Some trash is piled up near
the door, waiting to be taken out.  The main area of the kitchen extends to the
north and east from here, a hodge-podge of business and insanity in motion.
Looking at the general cleanliness, however, you think this would be a good
place to eat.

   This is a quiet, darkened corner -- it appears someone has put out the
lantern here on purpose.  You feel a chill, probably due to your distance from
the fire, and rub your arms absently.  There's a table set near the corner, a
single chair behind it in the shadowy of shadows.  You get the cliche'd feeling
someone in robes should be sitting there.

all customers with impunity.  A few tables are empty here in the southern part
of the wayhouse, but the whole place still has that 'mostly filled' air to it.
The dull roar of conversation and the warm air from the fire makes you feel at
home somehow, makes you want to have a seat.

off the polished handrail.  An arch to the east opens up into the main room...
Where the noise informs you that the revelry hasn't stopped yet.

oak in contrast of the heavy stone of the exterior walls.  A light at the top

   Um.  Whew!  It's definitely an outhouse...  Doesn't smell too good at all.
There's a wooden plank with a few 'convenient' holes cut in it for service, and
several curtains hung up for privacy.  A bowl with a large cake of soap next to
it serve as sanitary measures.  Otherwise, there's not too much here that you
take an interest in...
