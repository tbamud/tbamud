AsA's Zone Description Room~
   I hereby present the wasteland area, availiable to those concerned.  I have,
deliberately, written short long_descriptions.  Because I consider them more
useful that way, since most DIKU's are not inclined towards questing.

The Ice Cave~
   You are inside the ice cave.  Some droppings, not too nice
looking nor smelling, have been spilled in the center of the cave.
Your basic knowlege of ichtyology tells you that this excrement
does not relate to the elusive Otopharynx lithobates, but to
something completely different.
