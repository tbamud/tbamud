Dragon Plains~
   A huge outstretch of sand is before you.  You notice a few scattered trees
and plants that should have been dead long ago.  A lot of the leaves on the
trees are missing.  They appear to have been torn off.  Several large foot
prints linger in the sand.

Dragon Plains~
   As you continue walking through the dry plains, you feel your feet sinking
into the sand, making it difficult for you to walk.  You can see a small stream
to the south.  But is it really there, or is it a mirage?

A Small Stream~
   You have come to a small stream filled with crystal blue water.  You look
into the water and see several small pebbles drifting through the current of
the stream.  You look ahead to see where the stream ends, and notice that it
disappears into the ground.

see the sand swallow the wood.  There is a slight incline here, causing some
drifts of sand to roll across your feet.  You feel the wind pick up as you
continue on your way.

A Huge Footprint~
   You have stepped inside the footprint of a very large creature!  You see
sand begin to fill in the large hole, threatening to trap you inside.  The
sides of the huge hole are sturdy enough to climb out of, but you'd better
hurry before you get burried alive.

Sand Drift~
   You find yourself standing on a small sand drift.  It's almost as big as a
hill, but not as steep.  Some dried up leaves lay at your feet, waiting to be
blown away in the wind.  You hear some birds singing in the distance.

could get any water out of here, not that anyone would want to.  The bottom of

A Small Walkway~
   The walkway is very well lit.  You can see that it leads back out into the
plains.  You suddenly feel relieved, knowing you made it out of the cave alive.

Skeleton Tunnel~
   As you continue walking through the tunnel, you notice a small window.
It's barely large enough for a small child to squeeze through.  The light of
the day streams down into the tunnel, showing you more of whats ahead.

   Some small bones line the floor beneath you.  You hear them snap and crackle
under your weight.  You begin to shiver from the cold.  Maybe if you could find

in the dirt here.  There might be enough to gather and make a small fire.  It
even looks as if other travellers have camped out here before.
