North Street~
   The gradual slope that was just west of here has turned into a steep hill
which climbs it's way up into the Wharf.  Seems the great people who make their
homes in the Wharf like to be able to look down upon those less fortunate and
watch them scurry about their daily lives.  The road heads east, uphill into the
Wharf, or west into the main business district of the Cove.

North Street~
   North Street heads east toward a huge building, apparently a home of some
sort.  Just before the home, it looks as if the road makes some sort of turn or
merges into another street which heads south.  Just south of your current locale
is a short brick wall which encloses a large park that from the looks of it, is
maintained quite regularly.  The road also heads west past a small cobbled
street and heads out of sight downhill toward McGintey's main business district.

   This park, kept up by the city commission, boasts a wide open expanse of
beautifully trimmed green grass complete with a fountain and playground
equipment for the kids.  It looks as if many a family has come here for Sunday
picnics from the way the people here simply saunter through the park without
fear of phsycial harm or theft.  To the south is more of this beautiful park,
east is Wharf Street.

run around your feet as you saunter through the park, enjoying the fresh air and
the tangy smell of the sea as the breeze wafts it your way every now and then.
The park continues north form here and Wharf Street lies just east.

   Upon entering this establishment (it could only be called an establishment

All the clientele at this establishment seem to be dressed in their Sunday
finest, the waiters and waitresses all decked out in tuxedos and beautiful
serving gowns.  The matre de gives a bit of a sniff at your appearance, but
quickly regains his composier as he asked if he can show you to a table.
