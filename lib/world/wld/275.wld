The Port Of New Sparta~
   You stare in astonishment at the modern metropolis of New Sparta...
After examining the sky for a few minutes, you realize an old sailor has
been staring at you the whole time.  As you gaze down at him, you notice
a strange aura around him.  When you finally decide to speak, the strange
sailor points to the city and says "With technology comes power and with
power comes DANGER!!"
   You turn to look back at the sailor and notice he is no longer there!
A feeling of hope and uneasiness pervades your body as you think about the
city of New Sparta!

   As soon as you enter a large mob of salesmen with vendor carts rush
up to you and push their cheap wares with inflated prices.  When they
see you have no intention of buying any of their goods, they disappear
as suddenly as they appeared.

   You are on Broadway, the main street of New Sparta.  Rows of stores
line the sides of the street as far as you can see.  You are impressed
by the modern technology and the sheer size of the buildings.  You are
confident that this city is at least 1000 times better than Midgaard.
    To the east lies the Fishery.  The west leads to the Tin Can Alley,
the economically challenged neighborhood (note the PC terminology).

the stadium which has the ability to retract during ideal weather
conditions (rain, sleet, wind and hail).  A large electronic screen
adorns the side of the edifice, promoting today's event.

Inside The WarDome~
   The inside of the stadium offers a dramatic contrast.  Like
the exterior, the stands offer the most luxurious accommodations for
the spectators.  The field however, is a battleground composed of mud,
turf and rock surrounded by an 8-foot high stone wall.  There are two
entrances to the playing field--as audience participation is welcomed,
though not strongly recommended.
   To the east are the Blue Seats, to the north are the West Stands.

The End of the Concourse~
   As you come to the end of the concourse, you find the entrance
to the East Stands of WarDome -- the SuperBoxes.  Unfortunately,
you are not permitted to go in as these are reserved for the very
elite.  There is a sign on the door to the SuperBoxes.
   After getting over your disappointment (you always wanted to
see the inside of a SuperBox), you notice that someone has rather
carelessly left open the door to the Visitor's Locker room, just
inviting someone to walk in.
   The concourse runs west, to the north you may enter the locker-
room.

showers here, as you'd probably only get more dirty attempting to.
As you peer through what little light there is, you notice a loose grate
in the far corner.  Letting curiosity get the best of you, you lift
up the grate and find a long ladder descending into darkness.

stools are personally melded to certain individuals' posteriors.

The Stairs To Melville's~
   You stand at the stairs leading up to Melville's Restaurant,
owned by that evil bald man, Jonathan Hill.  There is a very sturdy
welcome mat at the bottom of the stairs with a picture of a duck on
it.  The mat does not tear or burn, and beating it with a sledgehammer
has no effect.  Keep in mind that if you want to go to Melville's,
you need a coat and tie.  Oh, and don't forget to wipe your feet.
   The stairs lead up to Melville's, to the north is the Main Bar
and to the west the bar continues.

hung here in loving memory of Coach Ernie Pantuzzo.

Cheers, behind a door.  To the east, you see the stairs to Melville's

The Pool Room~
   As you look about the pool room, you think to yourself, gee, if only
I could get Norm drunk enough to win money off of him.  Then you realize
that 1) you couldn't afford the money it would take to get him drunk, and
2) you really don't think Norm would ever leave his stool unguarded.  You
see a pool table and pool sticks.
   The bar stools are to east.

Melville's Restaurant~
   This is the famous restaurant upstairs from the Cheers bar.  It
is currently owned by the evil bald man, Jonathan Hill.  Although the
company might be bad, you are definitely assured to get a good meal.
If you aren't wearing a jacket and tie, you'd better leave fast before
Mr. Hill gets snotty and throws you out (but you can always steal their
mints!).
   The Cheers Bar is downstairs.

   As you enter the office, the first thing you notice is a very
comfortable couch and you realize that it has been used for more
than midday naps.  You also infer from the couch that the desk has
been used for more than business work (well, maybe it's been used
for a different kind of business).
   The bar is to east.

   This is the residence of one of the most uninspired and uninterested
mayors since Maryon Barry (sorry, he's in the jail at the moment!).  The
office makes you feel like your being watched and then you recall all the
rumors you heard about the mayor's link to Satan himself (which would
explain him damning everyone).

   This is a very classy reception for a very classy hotel.  This fact
is proven by the sheer beauty of the receptionist.  Hey, they can afford
to pay for the high prices of supermodels and Playboy Playmates.
   The lobby to the Waldorf is downstairs.
