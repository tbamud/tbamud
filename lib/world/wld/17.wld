A Muddy Trail~
   Your feet squish down into the mud making each step a struggle to pull your
foot free.  This trail looks heavily travelled with wagon tracks and horse
hooves turning it into a thick muddy slime.  Through the thick forest to the
east you see the western wall of Bellau City.  Through a thin covering of trees
to the west you see a massive body of water.

East Lane~
   A battlement above the main gate towers over you to the north.  You are
on a lane that parallels the eastern wall of this fortress.  You can follow
it to the south or enter the courtyard to the west.  Out in the courtyard
you see a couple groups of people talking amongst themselves.  Maybe they
can give you some answers to what's going on.

Courtyard~
   You are standing in the southeastern section of the courtyard.  A small road
branches off to the east.  Several people are standing around in the courtyard
looking at the main gate, but no one is leaving.  You notice guards are blocking
anyone from leaving the castle.  It looks like you might be stuck here.

Courtyard~

missing.  Only a few people are walking around through the courtyard and none of
them are going towards the gate.  They all look at each other and especially at
the guards distrustfully.

Flanking the road are the standards of the other knights of the round table.  A
strange peace fills the air here.  Knights Way continues to the north and the
Tourney Yard of Camelot is to the south.

right up against the western wall of Bellau City, and to the west, through a

ocean?  You're not sure.

small dagger, tossing it 10 feet in the air, catching it by the blade and then
burying it in the middle of a bale of hay 20 feet away.

this would be the best place to start.

Open Field~
   The smell of freshly plowed, highly fertile soil fills your nostrils.  The
ground here has been plowed and several serfs are dutifully picking rocks out of
the field and throwing them into the lake.  You duck as they don't seem to care
whether they hit the lake or you.

A Muddy Trail~
   You are covered in mud from the knees down as it's almost impossible to keep
your balance on the slimy road.  The trail narrows and the forest has already
began to reclaim the path as its own.  The western wall of Bellau City is still
to the east and you hear the gentle lapping of waves on the shoreline to the
west.

   The shadows are even deeper in the southeastern corner of the castle.  The
south and east walls meet each other and leave you with the choice of exiting
north or west.  A beggar looks up at you, raising a small tin cup, a glimmer of
hope in his eyes.  A set of stairs are carved into the wall to the west, leading
up into the tower.

   Very few people are out and about the streets which seems strange for a
castle this size.  An unlawful merchant suddenly walks up to you showing you a
note that looks to be signed by the king himself.  He starts to tell you what
it's about, but then a guard rounds a corner to the west and the merchant
immediately walks away from you.
