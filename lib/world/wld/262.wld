Forest Trails Zone Description Room By Kaan~
   *The Forest Trails *Modified by Kaan for Dibrova This is the same Forest that
is available on the CircleMud site, a lump of same descrip rooms which work as
an extremely effective connector zone off of any city.  I added some mobs and eq
which are not part of the package you receive from the CircleMud download.
Apologies to the original builder if I have offended at all by reposting this
zone on my webpage, just thought that others might appreciate the mobs and eq as
well.

   As your eyes get used to the dimness, you can see a little way to either
side, a sort of darkend green glimmer.  Ocassionally a slender beam of sun has
the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above, and still more
luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs beneath.
