Vice Island Zone Description Room~
   Vice Island is an evil-only area. It's rather large for a medium-sized MUD
and is intended to be used in concurrence with Oceania.
This area is intended to be part 1 of 4 subareas I have in mind for Oceania.
It has mainly evil mobs, and almost all of the equipment in it is evil only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I make no legal claim on Vice Island save this: You MUST give me credit for
its design SOMEPLACE in your mud. You can hide it if you want, but I want
some credit somewhere for it. :) I spent 6 months making Oceania and Vice
Island, and I feel some need to have it known that my work is appreciated.

Port Harem~
   You stand on a blindingly white beach; it stretches to your north and south
as far as you can see.  Hundred of beautifuly garbed women of all shades
languish on the shore; they have stony-dull eyes that stare right past you.
Something looks not-quite-so-right in this pristine place.

sand beach~
   Close examination of the beach shows that the sand is not only white--each
and every grain is a single crystal; it reflects the light of the sun into a
blinding display of bright white.  While each one exhibits a different color,
they all blend into this pristine color.

Beachside Harem~
   Now THIS is weird.  Frightened women scamper out from a hole in a huge mound
and you can hear screaming from down in the depths.  A large forest lies to

Beach Road~
   This path is extremely well-kept.  Small stones line the outer path, and the
sand from the beach has been lain to make a path--though the crystal seems to
have been melted down to make the floor harder.  The palm trees here completely
fill every part of the area outside the path.  Strange noises and utterly
blood-chilling screams fill the air.  It is very dark here.  The path leads on
to your west, and a strange mound lies to your east.

Harem~

women dance before you, twirling in silk gowns that barely hide their beauty.
A sound can be heard over all the racket, shouting, "Keep working!  "

   You stand at the zenith of a tall hill overlooking the entire island.  The
view here would be breathtaking, were it not so sinister.  You can see a gooey,
tarry brine to your north, and to all other directions a sinister, black forest
is eerily silent.  If you look very carefully, you can see the harbours to your

Through the Trees~
   Someone has most convieniently placed netting through the trees here, so you
may walk along it without fear of falling.  This is probably best, as you are
extremely high up from the ground.  You hear birds chirping right by you, and
feel very peaceful here--that is, as long as you are in the trees.  You may go

Port by the Forest~
   You are at an extremely weird dock.  It's raised high on stilts on one
side-- apparently keeping you from falling off of a cliff.  Netting starts out
to your south, keeping you from falling through the trees.  You can see a large
tar pit to your south--good thing there's that netting to keep you from falling
into it.

Hall of Wax~
   Gory statues line this hall--statues of all kinds of torture, from the most
mundane iron-maiden experience to the more imaginative things one can do with a
cat-of-nine tails and razors.  The thing that makes these statues most
uncomfortable to look at is the fact that they are made from wax--and look so
lifelike you can almost see them screaming in terror.  Do you see one move?
No, it must be your mind playing tricks on you.

   This is certainly not your average office--certain telltale signs lead you
to this fact.  Perhaps it's the skulls lined up on spikes around the room.
Or, perhaps the fact that it looks to be several rooms.  You really don't want
to be here.  You can go south or north...  Neither way looks too comforting.

Hall of Torture~

You feel somewhat turned around.  As you look around you, you are overcome with
nausea as you realize immediately that you shouldn't have.  Many items of
torture lie around here, some that you'd never imagined could have been invent-
ed.  Certainly not by a sane person.  You can go to your east(oh, so that's how
you get back to the entrance), or to the south, into another chambre.

   Dead bodies lie strewn about here.  They appear to have been killed from the
devices in the Hall of Torture.  You certainly don't want to think too long
about it, as they are so mangled you can't tell what they were--whether they
were human or other.  You can get out of here by going back to the Hall of
Torture, to the Temple of Terror to your east, or to the Office of the High
Priest to your south.

Office of the High Priest of Terror~
   This is probably the most beautiful part of the entire island you have seen.
Amazingly enough, there are no signs of the carnage and disgusting methods of
torture that can be seen throughout the rest of the buildings you've viewed.
In fact, this place looks downright natural.  A nice desk made of redwood is
the frontpiece of the room, and a high-backed chair is behind it.  A plush sofa
is in front of it, and plaques and other credentials line the walls.  An
insignia--the cat o' nine tails--is frosted into the only window in the room.

plaques~
   These aren't awards--they're decrees and petitions outlining the law of Vice
Island.  Each one is more severe than the last.  What you basically glean from
the rules of the land is that while this once was a prosperous island, several
people began to experiment with dark magic, and began to mu268le in affairs they
had no business in.  Eventually, the island became nothing more than a place for
several delvers to take up shop--and build a religion based mostly on the most
horrible feelings in life--Despair, Hopelessness, Fear, and the crowning
emotion, in which all these culminate--Terror.  Not a pretty picture.

Entrance to the Temple of Terror~
   The entrance to this temple is blinding--that's probably the most noteworthy
point of note.  Flashes of light emenate from a globe in the center of the
room, causing strange effects in the room.  The room is made from a metal that
reflects the light like a mirror--but brighter.  You can go to the strange
trail to your north, or on into the temple to your east.
