An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
   This path appears to be very old, and well travelled.  It amazes you that
you have never noticed it was here before.  That is until you look back and
realize that the clay road is completely invisible to you from here.  To the
east, the path continues.  It appears that the western opening you entered
through is now impassible.  You are here whether you like it or not....

An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
   The path is becoming more and more difficult to traverse now, as the trees
seem to reach out to strangle you.  You feel like you are utterly alone, and,
if not for the mountain you can now see in the distance, would probably just
recall to Midgaard.  But then again, who ever said that adventuring was easy?

The End of the Ancient Path~
   You finally burst free from the grasp of the wood, only to find yourself at
the foot of a path.  The path leads north, to the mountain which has, until now
been your only beacon.  Now that you can better see the ominous mountain
looming before you, you begin to rethink the idea of recalling to Midgaard.

Path to the Mountain~
   You are on a small nondescript path leading northward to the mountain.  The
closer you get to the mountain, the worse you feel about the whole thing.  You
begin to remember hearing old stories about a hidden mountain, which was, for
some unknown reason, named DragonSpyre.

   You are on a small nondescript path leading northward to the mountain.  The
closer you get to the mountain, the worse you feel about the whole thing.  The
deep stench of dragon is wafting through the air now, and you are starting to
feel the first tinges of dragon fear stir within you.  Maybe you should go back
while you still have that option.

At the foot of the Mountain~
   You have reached the foot of the great mountain.  Here, the dragon stench is
almost strong enough to disable you.  The only way you are able to stand it is
by ripping of a piece of cloth, and covering your mouth and nose with it as you
walk.  Far above you, you see what must be the entrance to the cave.

   Now that you have something to somthing to concentrate upon, scaling the
mountain, you are actually able to think more clearly.  You have encountered
dragons before, and vanquished them, why should these be any different.  This
thought continues rolling through your mind, but as you reach the next level of
the cliff, it does little to ease your fear.

   You are now close enough to the entrance to hear the sounds from within.
The first thing you are aware of is that the mountain itself seems to breathe.
In and out goes its breath, constantly in and out.  You suddenly hear footsteps
approaching from all around you, and brace for combat.  It takes you a few
moments to realize that the sound was your heart beating.

To the east is the entrance to what seems to be a small cave.  The only hint as
to the size of the cave are the screams that are echoing from within it, which
seem to last an eternity.

   Once inside the cave you feel completely lost to the outside world.  All
around you are horrific sounds of death and fear.  The walls are all stained
with many differing shades of red or brown, with a few frost particles
glittering on one of the walls.  Even with the cloth, the smell of the dragons
is almost unbearable.

through DragonSpyre, the screams had been slowly dying off, and now they are no
more.  Normally the lack of death cries would be a welcome change, only now
they have been replaced by a very eerie silence.  You don't like this one bit.

   You have made it passed the white dragon, the first of your challenges.
Now, you are entitled to his treasure...  If you can find it.  The hallway here
is colder than the rest of the cave.  You assume that the white dragon made
frequent passes through here to make sure his gold was still intact.  You begin
to hope that it wasn't a baby....

Treasure Room~
   All alround the horde of the white dragon glimmers.  It appears that he hass
been collecting for quite some time.  There are little bits of everything here,
from broken swords, to the leg bone of a dracolich.  The main thing that
catches your eye is the large pile of gold resting all around the room.  You
are about to claim it as your own, when you are struck from behind...

   The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here, the
walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.  It feels
like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on for all
eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might not be that
long of a distance.

   Within the bounds of this room, time has seemed to stop.  There is no
movement, save for the large mass at the back of the room.  Out of the corner
of you eye, you manage to catch a glimpse of a droplet of water "falling" from
a stalagtite...  It appears to have been in the same position for the past
century.  You have no chance to move before the Dragon strikes.

   All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.  It
has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the Dragon
and the original families considered these items "treasure", you manage to find
little of value beside a pile of gold coins you collect.

Walking through DragonSpyre~
   The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here, the
walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.  It feels
like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on for all
eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might not be that
long of a distance.

Throne room of the Pixie King~
   The throne room is remarkably well kempt considering the anarchy of the
Pixie hierarchy.  The power of the time dragon does not seem to affect this
room in the least bit.  There is a humongous throne sitting at the far end of
the room.  There appears to be a Pixie engulfed in it.

The End of the Hallway~
   You have come to the end of the hallway.  As you enter the room, you hear a
slight rumbling coming from the eastern wall.  You look, and see that the wall
has opened to reveal a safe passage to the beginning of the cavern.  There is
also an exit to the north.
