   *Rahn Grasslands - by Kaan for Dibrova
This is an area designed for exp gain geared toward the low to mid-level
player.  The mobs are all aggro and sneak, as they are plainsmen and
live in the high grasses in this zone.  The zone is basically a large
square of connected rooms with a space in the center for a road to cut
through, running north to south - that road is in the Light Forest if
you desire to use the Light Forest zone as well.  There is a windmill
in the northwest quadrant of this zone, also a zone available to download.
No objs are included with this zone as it is strictly meant as a filler
zone made for good exp.

Replace XXXX with a town name of your choosing.

Obscure Path~
   As it turns out, the path leads downhill, although from your vantage point
west of here, you could not tell that.  It seems that the continuing brush you
thought was a large field is actually tree tops!  The path continues east,
becoming more and more enclosed as you move in that direction.  To the west the
path heads uphill into a huge grassy field.

Obscure Path~
   The path continues downhill at a steep angle to the east, uphill to the west.
Just east of you, you think you may see some sort of break in the trees, as the
forest you entered into seems to have come upon you quite suddenly.
