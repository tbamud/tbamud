Theme        : The zone is the town ship for the undead. Totally against the
               living.
Notes        : It could be converted into a starting town if we want. It is not
               quite good enough for that right now, but close. Almost

Central Taking~
   Surrounded by a humid abundance the room seems to spin around in circles
cornering every angle as a fat retraction.  Probably the only dry area around
the lands, this clearing seems to be the only place a tired rack of bones or a
blood drenched undead could probably call close to home.  Dust particles float
around the air in a weird sort of lingering cloud.  Sounds of mourning,
creaking and shaking can be heard from as far as the eyes can see.

Badlands~
   Moving onto highgrounds the swamp waters start to dry beneath your feet.
Circles of small puddles gather water into your footwear, making them gushy and
uncomfortable.  In the Badlands the skys above paint a gray ceiling that never
changes through weather.  The surroundings show nothing but broken wood and
moss, eminating a foul smell that gathers into your nostrils and greens your
thoughts into what may lay ahead of this damned place.

Badlands~
   The monotonous sky and surroundings depress even the most lifeless of souls.
This is the undeads own personal hell that they may call their own.  The fetid
water and dead or decaying plantlife is sobering and a good example of the
frailty of life.  The undead rule this world whether the living realize it or
not.  An old building in as bad a condition as the rest of the swamp looms
overhead in the branches of a large tree.  A set of stairs lead up to an dark
empty doorway.

Badlands~
   The murky waters of the swamp recede slightly as you climb onto higher
ground.  Several stakes and crosses have been nailed in a circle, displaying
the remains of the few living who tried to enter this deadly abyss.  To the
west a large tree cradles a small building in its limbs.  The loud clank and
shriek of metal being shaped can be heard within.

   The howl of wind passing through the hollow dead limbs of the trees is the
only sound that can be heard.  Though the wind blows fervently, the clouds
above do not change.  The land is barren and lifeless.  Pools of water and muck
appear untouched and undisturbed.  Nothing living dares pass this way.

Badlands~
   The murky waters of the swamp rise to just below your knees.  The smell is
overpowering, emanating from the dead plantlife and even a few bodies that
float past.  The sky above remains unchanged and unmoving, as if frozen in
time.  These swamps are the home to those who have foresworn life.

Badlands~
   The gray ceiling of clouds above stays motionless, as stagnant as the fetid
waters through which you trod.  A cave can be seen leading into the bowels of
the badlands.  The trees and plantlife surrounding it and you are dead and on
the last stages of decomposition, like everything else in this place of
damnation.

   A circle of dead trees encloses three quarters of this room, leaving the
only exit to the south.  A large board has been erected on the northern wall.
Messages are written on scattered parchments about the room, some in blood,
some in even less pleasing bodily fluids.  This is the meeting room of the
undead where they may plot and scheme their corruption and consumption of the
living world.

Wetlands~
   The stone remains of a ruined city are slowly being consumed by the rot and
decay of the swamp.  A few small stone buildings can be seen struggling to
remain above the murky waters.  To the north an entire building looks almost
untouched by the surrounding swamp.

Wetlands~
   As windy hazes blow against the thick serenity of the atmosphere, sharp
piercing screeches can be heard somewhere in the vicinity.  As water levels
rise along the dead branches, the continuing need for life around this region
has diminished to an absolute null.  Dead bodies of those once loved, float on
the surface waters of the wetlands getting trapped in between the dead and
rotting overgrowned weedgrass.  A strange stairway of the thick fog looks solid
enough to walk on.  It rises high above you into a low hanging cloud of white
vapor.

Wetlands~
   Slabs of smooth stone jut up out of the swamp, encircling and enclosing
everything within, except for a small gap in the stones to the north and south.
The walls of rock are the only remains of an unkown civilization that has been
buried and forgotten in the realm of the undead.  To the south you can see a
faint trail that looks drier than the surrounding area.

Wetlands~
   The muddy water and muck relentlessly tries to pull you down with each step
you take.  The sucking sound of your footsteps is broken only by a shrill
ceaseless scream in the distance.  The clouds overhead are motionless.  They
look superficial, the only movement is that of a thin layer of fog rising off
the murky water.

Wetlands~
   The swamp gives way here to even deeper waters.  A curtain of fog rises off
the warm water into the cooler air, reducing visibility and attenuating any
sound.  The waters are an unhealthy shade of black and gray.  Making it
impossible to judge the depth or see what lies underneath.  A few ripples in
the water are the only sign of life in this hell hole.

   Dead trees covered in a black moss rise out of the swamp like skeltal
fingers trying to claw their way out of their swampy graves.  Large pools dark
water reflect the strange unchanging sky above.  Small trailers of fog rise off
the warm water and dissipate into the cool, still air.

   The lack of life and movement makes the dead swamp look more like a painting
than reality.  Filthy water, dead trees, rotting debris floating motoinless in
the still waters.  A large sinkhole has collapsed here.  Revealing a dark
cavern below.

   The remains of a once impressive stone structure lies collapsed all about.
Fluted columns of marble and granite stand naked with no roof to cover them.
A once marvelous cobblestone road has been desecrated and broken by years of
neglect.  The remnants of a few small buildings still remain.

   The remains of a stone staircase lead up into an ancient stone structure.
The walls, ceilings and floor changes from stone slabs constructed centuries
ago to bare cavern walls of strange colors.  A thin film of ice covers
everything as a frozen breeze from the east keeps everything frozen.  Nothing
living is in evidence.

around the encroaching swampland is beginning to reclaim this fallen city.

Stone Ruins~
   A large, almost pyramid-like, structure to the east blocks out the remains
of the remainder of this once beautiful city.  A few other buildings remain,
ready to collapse at any time.  To the north and south are two such buildings.
Neither have doors since the wood has rotted away decades ago, the only remains
are the stony skeletal walls and roof.

Swampy Flats~
   The wail of a lost soul pierces the stagnant air.  The shriek echoes off the
dead tree stumps and seems to come from several directions.  The presence of so
many undead have sucked the life out this land.  Nothing living moves.  From
within these realms comes the source of the undead, and no one has yet to
discover what or where it is.

Swampy Flats~
   Painting a dark protrait of black across the surrounding skys, the muddy,
swampy grounds below you seem to blend directly into the ebony views as it hits
towards a pseudo horizon that never seems to get brighter no matter the
distance closer.  Broken root arms bend and twist around each other in a static
dance that lasts forever.  The opaque grounds below cover stories of great wars
and treason burried into the ground.  Leaving behind nothing but a legend and
scattered armors collected by merchants and sold to far away realms.

Swampy Flats~
   The swampy slime that used to be water reeks of refuse and decay.  Various
unidentifiable objects float on or near the surface of the black liquid.  The
footing is unsure and treacherous, dangerous to anyone afraid of drowning, but
nothing more than a nuisance for those that call this place home.  The land of
the undead is no place for the living.

Swampy Flats~
   Large bubbles rise and break through the filmy surface of the swamp,
emitting rank gasses from decaying matter.  Sinkholes threaten to swallow the
few remaining dead trees and trespassers that remain in the area.  The silence
is broken only by an occasional shriek or moan from deep within the wastelands.

   The cavern walls seem painted in strains of different colors from red to
violet.  All colors of the spectrum fill the room and give it a strange feeling
of being in motion.  The occasional tremor causes dust and small rocks to shake
loose from the ceiling and walls.

Cave-in Tundra~
   Down in the tundra, the sounds of never ceasing boulders and large rocks
crashing down, a descending faced cave-in wall in which you are standing now.
The colors of these rocks are as vibrant as they are large.  Yellow, brown and
red and all different strains of concentration, running up and down, as if
painted formations.  The ground below always trembling giving off an uneasy
feeling of being swallowed deeper into this tundra.

consists of small rocks of every color making travel precarious at best.  The
walls are striated with strange colors and shapes, almost as if painted.

   The remains of a recent collapse has opened even more of the cavern.
Stones of random size and color cover the floor.  Nothing can live in this
frozen rocky grave.  No moss or lichen is visible on any of the rocks.  The
wind howls through the empty cavern like a mother mourning for the loss of her
children.

forming natural pillars to support this underground cavern.

to try and steal from this bank.  The walls are crumbling into dust, debris
from the ceiling lies about the floor, making an excellent skylight through
which you can see the gray unmoving clouds above.

Cages line all the walls filled with animals.  A small boy tends to them with

fesces, and animals.

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   Make two rooms and some pets.  The rooms MUST be sequential.  If the first
room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.

   A hard rock bottom stops of the movementive drips coming from the higher
wetlands.  Creeping vines flourish and seemingly thriving on the liquid compose
that Iuel has managed to gather in it's gruesome arms.  A smooth bowl carved
from the fluid's weight takes center stage gathering more foul smelling liquid,
attracting the strangest insects.  Amplified sounds of dripping fluid can be
heard from all over.

of blood and flesh, spilt and cutt off from fallen fighters leaves this place a
terrible adventuring spot.  Soft walls of this sink hole crumbles slowly
expanding it's diameter century over century.  Absolutely no light penetrates
into this cavern trapping humid coldness in the air and a nerve racking
silence.
