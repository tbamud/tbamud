   You are on the Western Highway east of here you can see the gates of the
Capital while to the west the highway continues.  A gravelled path leads
northward, away from this boring highway, towards some rocks a bit further
north.

be seen to the east.  The highway stretches from the west towards the gates.
A light forest to the north of pines and small saplings looks peaceful.

   The wester highway passes in front of a large wooden building.  The building
is in disrepair, with shingles lying on the ground and a porch that looks like
it could collapse any second.  A faded sign swings on rusty hinges that squeak
annoyingly.

directly into the forest and disappears around a bend a short distance through
the trees.  The more heavily travelled western highway continues east and west.

   The highway consists of hard packed dirt, making travel very easy.  A warm
breeze blows to you from over the plains to the south.  It carries a slight
hint of smoke with it, civilization must be near.  To the north a thick forest
blocks your view.

   The Western Highway ends abruptly at a collapsed bridge.  A raging river
flows beneath it slowly washing the remains of the bridge away.  Debris and
sand has been scattered everywhere.  The river must have overflown and washed
the bridge away.

   You venture on a small, dirt road through the woods.  It looks well
travelled.  It seems to lead on to the north as well as to the south, where you
can see the Western Highway.  The thick forest continues on both sides of the
dirt road.

   The dirt road becomes more rough further to the north.  It seems less
travelled in that direction.  The thick coniferous forest seems to be starting
to thin out into a variety of hard woods.  Young maple trees seem to be
dominating this part of the forest.

the path, hanging around you.  Thick underbrush has begun to form to the sides
and the road looks unkept.  It is slowly being consumed by the forest around
it.

   The sounds of wildlife fill the woods.  Birds, squirrels, and other unseen
animals stay just out of sight.  They seem unused to travellers and are very
wary.  The trees continue to thin to the north.

saplings.  The path is barely distinguishable from the rest of the overgrowth.

   Several fallen trees block the path to the north.  They appear to have been
cut down and fallen over the path, as if to block it.  The smell of fresh pine
must mean they were cut recently.  Through the brush and trees to the north you
can just barely make out what looks like a gate and a city wall.

to the north.  Tall fields of wild grass, weeds, and other small brush borderw
the road.  The fields have grown to about waist height and could be used easily
to conceal oneself within.  The grass sways gently in the breeze.

around a huge pile of rocks to the southeast.  The remains of a stone wall runs
through the middle of the pile.  Once used to mark out boundaries between land
owners.  Now it seems no one is farming on these plains.

   The dirt path that you are on continues off to the south and also to the
north.  The plains are overgrown and should be farmed, especially since it is
so close to the Capital.  Instead they appear empty and deserted.  Very little
sign of travel or civilization can be seen, except for a plume of smoke rising
far to the west.
