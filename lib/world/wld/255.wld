Old Sailor's Home~
   You enter into a small cavern about ten by ten in diameter.  The flickering
light you noticed earlier comes from a campfire in the center of the floor.
Crude furniture made from driftwood and rocks lies strewn about, and some
raggety clothing hangs on a peg of wood jammed into a crack in the stone wall.

   *Shipwreck
*Written for Dibrova by Kaan
This is a subterranean ship stuck in cave-in with a bunch of aggro pirate
ghosts who are also invisible.  Some decent eq for the mid-level player as
well as some good experience.  Connects to Beach and Lighthouse area, also
available for download.
Zone 255 is linked to the following zones:
265 Beach & Lighthouse             at 25507 (up   ) ---> 26506
265 Beach & Lighthouse             at 25531 (west ) ---> 26502

Skeleton Room~
   This room looks to have been used as a sort of holding cell for crew members
who commited crimes or for unwanted stowaways.  A pile of human bones sits in a
corner, being the only thing in the room except, of course, for the ever
lingering stale smell of death.

On a Rope Ladder~
   You begin climbing down the rope ladder.  Below you, there is a mist
obscuring all except a foot or so below you.  In fact, you can barely see your
feet as they descend.  The air around seems to much more damp than the air
above, near the sea.  You can hear a creaking noise, a noise made up of many
different pitches, all blended into one, like a hundred grannies rocking in old
chairs all at once.

Out of the Mists~
   As you descend farther down the ladder, the mists begin to part, and what you
see below you takes your breath away.  You find yourself in an immense cavern,
the floor of which is all sea water.  Floating on the sea floor of this cavern,
directly below you, and from the looks of it, entombed here forever, is a huge
saling vessel.  The rope you are on drops you onto the crow's nest of the main
mast of this ship.  You see no movement on deck, not that you expected to, as it
looks as if this ship has been here for many decades, possibly even centuries.

Crow's Nest - Main Mast~
   You stand on a small round platform which encircles the top of the main mast.
A set of small iron rungs lead down the mast to the deck at midships.  Rigging
surrounds you on all sides, but none of it looks too stable.  The rope ladder
ascends up through the mists.

Gangway - Midships~
   You stand in the center of this once-mighty vessel, gently rocking with the
water beneath.  You can hear no sound but that of the ship creaking beneath you,
the crew that ran this proud ship must have long since deserted it or died
trying to get it out of this cavern.  The gangway runs north to south the length
of the ship.  The gunwales lies east and west of you.

Gangway~
   Your footsteps echo hollowly on the old planking, giving you a sense of
danger impending.  A hatch in the floor here gives you access to the lower deck.

Gangway at Foremast~
   The foremast raises from the deck here, rotted rigging still attached to
tattered sails.  The ganway continues on north and south of you.

Forecastle~
   You stand near the front most section of the ship, with the cavern wall
staring you right in the face.  You can now see how the ship got trapped in this
cavern.  It looks as if at one time this was a small cove with deep enough
waters to harbor a ship.  The northern wall, now a tremendous pile of rubble,
must have come down, sealing the ship in.

At the Wheel~
   Here the huge wheel of the ship still rests in place, not a scratch or nick
on it.  A compass sits in its stand here as well, also still in fine condition.
You may head north along the gangway or south to the stern.

Stern~

The floors here still seem to be free of any litter or debris, strange for a
ship that appears to have been stuck in one place for so long.

   You stand in a small, cramped corridor which runs north to south.  You notice
doors spaced at intervals in front and behind you, but none next to you.  Doors

Captain's Quarters~
   This is easily the biggest single room on the whole lower deck of the ship,
not that that is saying too much.  A large, quite comfortable looking bed rests
against one wall, a desk, nailed to the floor, sits at another end with a stool
similarly attached to floor.

Bunk Room~
   This room is where the majority of the crew must have slept.  Bunks built
into the walls of this room make small alcoves for each sailor.  The cushions in
each have long since rotted into decay, and even the wood which fashioned these
walls looks now so rotted as not to be able hold any one man's weight.

room, awaiting use, seeming almost to smile at you, daring you to use it.

flickering light inside which could be a campfire, could be a lantern.  It also
could be a cook fire - a cook fire to cook you!
