Main Room - Windmill~
   This small, dirty room looks like no one has been in it for quite some time.
A broken chair lies mostly in pieces in one corner, and a table with three legs
lays at an angle in the middle of the floor.  Stairs lead up to the upper
reaches where the wheel must have been maintained when this was in working
order.

   *Windmill
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova
This is a windmill set in the middle of a grasslands area, also available for
download, which has a underground area which house the Militant Order of the
Sword (the MoS), a militant organization dedicated to the eradication of
the Elven race.
There is a small quest built into this zone in conjunction with the Elven
zone.  The MoS stole the Lore Tapestry from the elves which depicts their
race's history and magic from the beginning of time.  When this Tapestry
is given to Reklan, an elf in the Elven zone, a player is rewarded.  The
Elven zone is not available for download on this page, however it can be
downloaded on the CircleMud site, without Reklan - he was added by Dibrova
after the download. If you would like a copy of the zone as we use it, please
contact Kaan via mudmail or email and request it.
* note: This zone is intended to be a low level zone, tailored for players
         who are just into their 10's. The mobs here don't assist and aside
         from a script on two of the mobs that only runs 10% of the time
         they don't aggro.
         This was made with the express intention of using it as an exp zone.

Upstairs - Windmill~
   This small room, more aptly called a platform because of it size (or lack
thereof) has absolutely nothing of interest.  Unless you are a dust collector.
Or some kid bringing his best girl out here.

Guard Room~
   There is absolutely nothing in this room, not even dirt, except for the two
well equipped men who stand waiting for innocent folk just like yourself to
blunder into this room.  A metal-made flight of stairs lead down into
who-knows-where.

Steel Clad Flight of Stairs~
   This flight of stairs lead down for quite a ways, with what appears to be a
door waiting at the end.  It could be something else, however, seeing as you are
quite a ways from it.  The walls around you, as well as the flooring you walk
upon, are all completely made of steel.  The effort and cost involved in the
construction of a passage such as this is beyond your comprehension.  What kind
of person or people decorate their walls in steel?

   The stairs continue down toward what is definitely a door at the bottom.
The metal which covered the walls up from here continues along these same walls.
The door ahead appears to be made of steel as well.

   The stairs ends here at a metal door.  Beyond is most probably the person or
persons responsible for the construction of this passage.  You may leave this
whole strange place, back up the stairs to a more stable world, or open the
door.

Checkpoint~
   The guards which stand at strict attention, the war banners on the metal
walls, the spotless uniforms which the guards wear all give you the clues you
need to put it together that this is a military installation of some sort.  You
see the letters 'MoS' emblazoned on the left breast of every guard's hauberk,
but you have no clue what they signify, nor do you have much time ti think about
as the guards attack.

assume it's quite large.

Weapons Cache~
   The floor is covered in crates and boxes, all with the stamp of the crossed
swords.  The etching underneath reveals the meaning of the letters you saw on
the door.  The etching reads; Militant Order of the Sword.  So this is a
military compound held by the Militant Order of the Sword, but who are they, and
what is their purpose?

There are only a few utensils lying on the one table, all utensils lined up
perfectly.  The one thing you can say positively about this kitchen is that it
is immaculately clean.

soldiers must live in this compound, judging by the immense size of this table.
A door leads south into the kitchen or you may head west out into the hallway.

a clean, no spotless affair with a polished steel floor.  Even the seats are
polished steel which even you would feel comfortable sitting on.

Training Room~
   The entire floor of this room is covered in a thin practice mat, which allows
for a bit of a more comfortable fall when practicing the art of fighting.  A few
targets are lined against the west wall, obviously for archery.  Some weapon
racks hang on the north wall, but currently there are no weapons in those racks.

it cheering.  The platform itself holds sixteen swinging bodies, all of them
