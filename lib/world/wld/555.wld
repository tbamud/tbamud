Ultima Description Room~
   A port of the Merc. Ultima area by Casret.
It is mostly ported from a mostly finished port to Smaug.
The area starts down in room 55685 and uses zone 555 and 556.

   The area ranges through all levels.

   The two mazes (Desert and Whirlpool) may have to be adjusted.
The maze progs of 130 (Welcor's Mist Maze) are much better but
seemed a bit too strong for the area.

Edits made for tbaMUD by Parna.
