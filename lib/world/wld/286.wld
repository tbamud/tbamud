Ancient Room~
   You are standing in a large stone room.  Feels like a crypt.  Ancient murals
of Hell and punishment cover the walls.  In the middle of the room are stairs
that lead down in to the darkness.  From the stairway you can smell brimstone
and sulfur.  To the west it looks as if there is a shrine.

Dark Stairway~
   You are standing at the bottom of long dark stairway.  The smells of
brimstone and sulfur choke you.  Screams of pain and terror fill the air.
Stone faces carved into the walls seem to laugh at you.  Maybe this is not such
a good idea after all...

Landing~
   This landing has been scorched as if a large brushfire had swept through it.
Bits of ash and burnt vegetation cover everything.  The walls and floor are
flawlessly smooth, and the ceiling is covered with carved faces and ancient
symbols and runes.  Large, black iron gates tower over you to the west.  You see
a large gateway to the west.

Gateway to Hell~
   You stand next to the very gateway of Hell.  You are surrounded by the sounds
of torture and pain.  Screams pierce the air and rattle your nerves.  Displays

you to the east.

walls are made up of various body parts and other unidentifiable things.  Many

sizes are being brought to the thresholds of pain and beyond.  Some are being
sliced into thousands of pieces.  Others are being stretched as though they were

and hamburger assault your senses.  All sorts of food lie everywhere you look.
Cookies, twinkies, steak, prime rib, almost anything you can think of, call out
to you.  You suddenly feel VERY hungry.

headboard of the bed are carved two cherubic looking figures, with the words

vandalized and torn apart.  What used to be the shrine has been reduced to a
large pile of stones and other debris.  Various runes and demonic faces have
been spray-painted on the walls and floor.  Nailed to the ceiling are an
assortment of skeletons.  All seem to have been dead for a very long time.  All
surfaces of the room are covered with dried blood and dust.

inside it.  They scream out to you.  The noise is deafening.  Several minor imps
and workers push more people into the pit, whistling while they work.

hall as you walk.  There is a strange and deathly silence that fills these
halls...  The hallway contines to the north and west.

smells of sulfur and methane.  To the south you see a stone hallway.  Hot air

to move slowly, changing the layout of the room.  As you examine the room
further you notice various posts around the room to which people are chained.
The firewalls seem to move in patterns that leave the poor people directly in
the path of the oncoming fire.  The walls seem to creep ever so slowly towards
them.  The people blister and scream as the fire gets closer.  Their deaths seem
like minutes of agony and pain, and even as they burst into flames they seem
incapable of grasping the merciful attention of death...  To the north you see a
hall of fire.  To the east you see a lake of fire.

Marble Hall~
   You are walking down a white marble hallway.  Large portraits of demons and

office to the south.
