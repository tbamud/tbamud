Wall Road~
   You are walking next to the western city wall. It is built from large
gray rocks that have been fastened to each other with some kind of mortar.
It is far too high to climb. People are walking past you, hurrying to
their destinations. To the north, you see the western bridge.

    |            NEW SOUTHERN MIDGAARD ZONE - FOR CIRCLEMUD 3.1           |
    |                      Written in 2002 by Crazyman                    |
    |                         www.nt.net/saarinen                         |
    x---------------------------------------------------------------------x
     I found the stock Southern Midgaard to be really confusing, so I
     decided to write a new one. This new zone features about 100 rooms,
     several new shops, a theater, and a curling rink. I've used a few
     of the old Southern Midgaard rooms and objects, but everything else
     is totally different.
     Stuff You Need to Change:
     -------------------------
     The Chain
        1. In 79.wld, find room 7914.
        2. Change the room leading down (D5) to 3135.
     The Southwestern Gate:
        1. In 35.wld, find room 3505. Change the room leading north (D0)
           to 3112.
     The Central Bridge/The Dump
        1. In 30.wld, find room 3025 (The Common Square). Change the room
           leading south (D2) to 3118.
        2. In 30.wld, find room 3030 (The Dump). Change the room leading
           north (D0) to 3044.
        3. In 30.wld, find room 3044 (Poor Alley). Add a room leading
           south (D2) to room 3030 (The Dump).
      (You don't HAVE to make the above changes. They are just what I
       decided to do on my MUD. Place the zone wherever YOU want!)

Emerald Avenue~
   You are on Emerald Avenue. The road looks brand new, as do the shops
and buildings that line the road. This is obviously the newer part of
Midgaard. People are bustling about, while street vendors are trying hard
to sell hotdogs and other less legal merchandise. Streetlights can be
seen along the road, and you also notice the odd tree.

The Southern Square~
   You find yourself in the middle of the Southern Square. Tall buildings
stand all around you, blocking out much of the sunlight. A twenty foot high
stone statue of a man stands here, surrounded by a ring of bushes and
flowers. From all around you, you can hear the bustle of daily city life in
Midgaard. The central bridge is north, leading to the old part of Midgaard.

stone statue man~
   The statue is of a man, looking up to the sky. He's dressed in a
suit, and he's wearing a top hat. At the base of the statue is
a plaque, which looks like this:

roof juts out from the northern building, just above the door. The overhang
sticks out about ten feet from the building, and is about twenty feet wide.
All along the bottom edge of it are lightbulbs. A double glass door leads
north, while a few signs have been set up here on the sidewalk. You
recognize this as the entrance to the Midgaard Theater.

On the Central Bridge~
   The central bridge is the main connection between northern and southern
Midgaard. The bridge is constructed from iron support beams and concrete.
It looks very solid. From below, you can see the swiftly flowing river,
leading east and west. The tall buildings of southern Midgaard dominate the
southern skyline, while you can see the huge temple of Midgaard off in the
north.

The Bank of Midgaard~
   You enter the doors and you find yourself in the bank of Midgaard. It's
a very large room, with high ceilings and a shiny polished floor. Large
windows let in light, giving the bank a bright glow. A long desk spans
the entire western wall, and behind it stand several tellers, looking
bored. An immensely thick steel door leads north, to the vault.

The Cooland Press Office~
   You find yourself in a quiet newspaper office. A row of darkly tinted
windows look out onto the street, making this place fairly dark. A high
desk stands directly in front of you, and from behind it you can see
many desks with computers on them. Journalists are seated, typing up
stories for the Cooland Press.

The Southern Docks~
   You're on the docks on the southern side of the river. The wooden docks
have been built fairly high off the river, making it impossible to access
the river from here. Several large crates and barrels are scattered around
here. Across the river, you can see the levee.

   The computer store is the only one of its kind in Cooland. This store
is very large, with very high ceilings and bright lights. Wide shelves,
twenty feet high, run the entire length of the store. Aisles run in between
them. Computer parts of all kinds are neatly stacked on the shelves. Several
checkouts are located beside the door.

rather low ceilings. Racks of clothing totally fill the store, making it

played.

South Gardens~
   You leave the street and enter a beautiful garden. Tall trees of all
kinds are growing here, and a winding gravel path leads to a set of benches
in the middle. You can see flowers growing along the path. Even though
you're in the middle of the city, you feel as though you're in a deep
forest. As your eyes adjust to the lower light, you notice a rope softly
swaying in the wind, behind a thick tree.

The walls are all solid wood. A large U shaped desk sits in the middle

Curling Club~
   You're inside the Midgaard Curling Club. A bar is located along the
western wall, and several large round tables are scattered around. Each
table has an ash tray on it, filled with ashes and cigarette butts. A railing
runs across the northern part of the room, and ten feet below it is the
spectators area. The wall in front of the spectators area is an enormous
window, looking out onto the curling rink. A small green safe with a beer
sticker on it sits in front of the railing, by the stairs leading down
to the hallway.

Curling Club Coffee Shop~
   You're inside the Midgaard Curling Club Coffee Shop. A rounded
wooden bar sits along the eastern wall, and behind it you see several
tables covered with glasses, and a large stove. About a dozen tables are
here, waiting for people to sit at them. Several thickly plated windows
look out onto the street to the south. The actual building looks very
solid, as if it was made to withstand an earthquake.

Sheet 1~
   You're standing at the southern end of sheet 1. The ice is slippery,
and it's fairly cold in here. You can hear the light humming of a machine
somewhere. Bright lights shine down on you from above, illuminating this
area quite well.

quite clean. Several toilets are here, along with some urinals with motion
detectors. No more touching filthy handles!

Passageway~
   You're in an old dark passageway. The paint is peeling off the walls,
and a single light bulb hangs from the ceiling. The floor is cement, and
has scuff marks all over it. The passage is quite wide. It seems as though
this hall used to be used for hauling equipment and goods. A rough wooden
door here leads south.

A Storeroom~
   You're inside an old dusty storeroom. White sheets cover several
large items, and they're covered with dust and cobwebs. You notice a
calender on the wall, and it's from over 30 years ago. This place
obviously isn't used anymore.

The Mayor's Office~
   You are in the not very big office of the Mayor of Midgaard.  A large and
polished but completely empty desk is standing in front of an armchair that
looks so comfortable that it most of all resembles a bed with the head end
raised slightly. Windows look in all directions, giving a great view of
the city.
