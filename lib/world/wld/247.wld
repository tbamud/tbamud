   You are on a well-kept gravel road that leads north-south through the
graveyard.  On both sides of the road, grave markers poke up out of the ground.
An iron grate is to the north.

   Graveyard by Rasta (Eric Pilcher) for KallistiMUD
In spite of it being my first attempt at an area, it didn't turn out to bad.
In fact, I was a bit shocked to receive praise now and then. The area connects
to South Midgaard at the grate (sexton has key).  It includes, although they
are modified, the original path amongst the evergreens and chapel that is found
in stock diku.
I recommend you do the following:
Replace the name "Someone" on the tombstones (.wld file) with the names of some
of your past players, gods, or your own creative names.  On Kallisti, I used
the Gods.  The collesuim belonging to the Implementor. Vary the contents of the
tombstones.  These are containers you can put small items in. If you have a
problem with key hoarders, consider a second entrance to the catacombs.
Perhaps through the sewers. Most of all, enjoy!

The Catacombs~
   The corridor continues both east and west.  You are almost completely
covered head to toe with cobwebs now.  They seem to cling to your body like
glue and it is impossible for you to avoid them.  You've yet to notice a single
spider, however.  The northern wall is in ruins as if something has broken it's
way through.  Large blocks of stone litter the corridor.  You could probably
squeeze through the hole if you so desired.

The Cobwebbed Catacomb~
   This area is almost solid cobwebs.  You trudge through them, trying to clear
a path.  As you brush them aside you notice that you've come to a dead end.
Closer examination reveals an archway to the south.  But so many cobwebs cover
the archway that they've formed a completely opaque door.  The corridor
continues back to the west.

   The air is very stale in here.  Cobwebs cover the walls and ceiling, however
the middle of the room is relatively clear of them.  In each corner of this
chamber, an ancient sarcophagus lies against the wall.  There is a low grinding
noise as they all start to open.  The only exit is north.

   This is the source of moaning.  The room is decorated with black curtains.
They look very moth eaten and mildewed.  A black sarcophagus lies on the floor
in the center of the room, and leaning over it, sobbing deeply, rests a
banshee.  She seems to be too interested in crying and wailing than to notice
you.  The door stands to the north and there are no other exits.

Upon the altar lies a skull on top of a pile of fine white dust.  Two large
rubies are placed within its eye sockets and its teeth glint of sparkling
diamonds.  You do not like the way it looks back at you and seems to grin.
You feel a presence of great evil in this room and you feel that you should
turn back, before something bad happens.
