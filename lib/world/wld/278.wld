Ocean Pier~
   You are on what once was a very busy ocean pier.  With the advent of tele-
portation, however, it is seldom used.  Stacks of lobster crates and fishnets
lie along the walk, and the cutting, salty smell of the ocean stings your nose.
You feel a sense of rejuvenation as you stare out into the sea.  You know many
adventures lie ahead.

fishnets nets~
   The fishnets are old and are turning into dust; large holes open to the
sides.  They don't look sturdy enough to use.

lobster crates~
   The lobster crates are old and rotting; they look as if they couldn't hold a
sardine.

In the Ocean~
   You are on the ocean.  Large waves rock the boat, and you have a hard time
keeping it from going off-course.  You realize that this will be hard work.
Seagulls chirp above, and whales spurt water far off into the horizon.  The
wind blows constantly here.  You can go your south.  To your north, you notice
a small island with a ship that appears to have been moored.  It looks board-
able.
