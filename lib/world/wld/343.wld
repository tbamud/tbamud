This path leads through a thicker part of the garden, however, to what appears o
be a Pagoda that is set back a ways from the others and the main part of the
garden.  Thick growth of planets, trees and bushes surround the building and
this path, The path itself is lined with bricks marking it easily to find your
way and lanterns hang from hooks every so many feet to light the way.

Opie's Office~
   You are standing on an immense, gray stone floor that stretches as far as you
can see in all directions.  Rough winds plunging from the dark, starless sky
tear savagely at your fragile body.  The stone floor is the same shade of gray
the sky and is completely plain and unscratched.  It is probably too hard for
anything to leave as much as a scratch on it.  Cold winds plunge ceaselessly at
you from the dark, cloudless sky.  An icy chill fills your blood, as you hear
an echoing guttural laugh.  "In the darkness there is light...  It's just
hiding...  Let me show you...  It is the mind that is erotic, the heart that
gives it life, the soul that makes it whole.", a voice whispers.  You jump
back with a shriek.  Nothing more but the beating of your heart.
