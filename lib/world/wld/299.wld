The Cathedral Courtyard~
   Leaves blown about by the wind of countless centuries fill this
lonely empty courtyard with their dull hollow rustle.  As you look
around an eerie feeling overcomes you, as if you are being watched.
   Just to the north, you see that the once beautiful double doors
leading into the cathedral proper have been torn from their frames
and left lying on the ground near the now open doorway.
   At the southern end of the courtyard, a large iron wrought gate
can be seen, creaking in the wind.  On the other side of the gate,
there seems to be an older road leading away from the cathedral.

Copyright 1995 by Curious Areas Workshop
*
This area is an abandoned cathedral with a twist.  It has been
overrun by evil and nasty undead but there are also good undead
attempting to contain these nasties.  There are also a few good
undead creatures deep in the catacombs below the cathedral.
The area consists of 56 rooms, 15 mobiles, and 17 objects.
N.B. The layout of the abandoned cathedral is loosely based upon
     an unfinished church created by CatsEye of VieMud 2.x
*
This area was built to conform to the standard Diku gamma 0.0
release.  Along with all other changes you must make to change
this area to your particular db flavor,
*** also, edit the following room:
#55 -- add an entrance/exit in a suitable direction and change
        the description to fit the surrounding area if neccessary.
*** You may wish to check the following objects to ensure that their
spells are the same as your Mud's spells:
#06    sleep (38), cure critic (15)
#07    sanctuary (36)
*** Finally... you may wish to check this sector number...
Since I couldn't find fly sectors in the original DikuMud, I used
9 as a sector for them.  The rooms to which this applies are:
#14, #50, #51, #52, #53
*
The mobs were built with a 'standard' 30-level, DikuMud in mind.
Armor classes range from +10 (bad) to -10 (excellent).
On VieMud, mobile ##05 (Wyrenthoth) was a snivelling excuse of a
dracolich, always whining about how it hated cold, damp, and closed
in spaces.  Also, if it was given object ##07 (the ivory staff),
it would give the key it held (##10) to the player in question
before crumbling to dust and bones.
All of the mobs with the exception of #00, #03, and #04 are
undead, and if possible, should be given some sort of undead
special procedures as suited.  Mobs #03 and #04 are evil clerics,
and if possible should be given specials to suit.
The 'boss' mobs of this area are really #03 and #06, so should
be suitably beefed up to suit.

door doors~
   The remains of the two doors that served as the main entranceway to the
cathedral are now lying in near ruins on the ground.  The doors are covered with
scuff and scratch marks and are merely a shadow of their former glory.

The Cathedral Entrance~
   In this large open area just inside the cathedral doors, you can
see the once beautiful font and the once pristine spring from which
the holy waters were once drawn.  All that remains now is the result
of the desolation, despair, and destruction caused by whatever turned
this cathedral into the ruin it is now.  It seems as though everything
here has been corrupted and spoiled.
   There are small alcoves to both the east and west.  The cathedral
also continues northwards towards where the altar should be.  There
is a large open doorway to the south, leading out to the courtyard.

The Aisle Of Pews~
   As you move through the cathedral, you find yourself fighting your
way through the numerous overturned pews here.  Interspersed amongst
the pews are mouldy remains of books.  Dust and decay covers everything
here, giving you the impression that nothing has been touched for years.
   The cathedral entrance is off to the south, and the altar is surely
located somewhere to the north.
   You hear a quiet wail coming from somewhere below.

The Worship Hall~
   This portion of the cathedral is an open area between the pews and the
altar.  This would have been the location where many of the worshippers
took their offerings.  But now only the decay of years remains.  Looking
around you spot what appears to be a stain on the ground and another on
the wall.  You also seem to hear louder wailings... or was it something
else?
   To the east and west, you can see what appear to be confessionals.
To the north there are some more pews, and to the south, you can see the
destruction where numerous pews have been strew about.

The High Pews~
   Standing amongst these pews, you notice that they appear to be in
better shape than the ones farther to the south.  Another noticable
thing is that the pews themselves seem to be of a much higher quality
than the ones to the south.  Perhaps this is where the nobles used to
worship.  Unfortunately, all has fallen into decay and neglect.
   The altar is located just to the north, but there is something ever
so slightly suspicious about it.  There is an open area to the south
just before the jumble of pews that can be seen there.

   These chambers are quite large and appear to be rather clean.  Looking
about, you notice that the beds are made and clean robes are hanging on
hooks by the heads of each one.  The beds are arranged so that the foot of
each is in the middle of the room, whilst the heads are in small alcove in
the wall.  There is a small chest at the foot of each, but a quick glance
reveals nothing out of the ordinary.
   The thing that strikes you most oddly about this room however, is that
there are no beds along the north wall, but there is a narrow door at the
east end of it.  A small curtain is located at the southern end of the room
and small windows line the east and west walls.

lined with chests.  There are no lights visible in the room, and even the
door to the south seems to have been a perfect fit in its frame.

   This looks to be an antechamber of sorts, but an antechamber to
what?  The walls have shelves upon them that are thick with dust.
The floor is covered with footprints marring the unvisited look that
this room seems to have been cultivating for quite a long time.  The
thing that strikes you as most strange about this room is perhaps the
almost new coffin sitting in one corner of the room.  The walls are
covered with mosaics and there is an archway set in the northern wall.

The Inner Crypt~
   You continue to wander through this inner crypt.  From past
experience, you know that this is often where the nobility of
the realm would be laid to rest after the elaborate ceremonies
took place upstairs in the cathedral proper.
   The only direction that the crypt leads is to the east.  The
floor is rather worn down in a track leading from the eastern
passage to the northern wall.

   This is the tomb in which the legendary Princess Evalynn has been
entombed for years and years.  Looking about this tomb, you notice
the numerous candles yet burning about an ebony coffin.  The room
smells of flowers, roses and carnations to be precise.  A slight
breeze makes the candles flicker momentarily.  The walls have been
painted with a multitude of small paintings and designs, probably
about the life of Princess Evalynn.

was forced to take the kingdom in hand and defend it against many attacks over
the years by those who thought that Gildoria would fall easily without any solid
male leadership.

cathedral's foundations.  Hundreds of thousands of bones lie about
the cavern in small piles.  There is a rather large pile off in the
northwestern corner of the cavern.  The stone of the floor has been
shaped to create a ledge of sorts in the southeastern corner.
