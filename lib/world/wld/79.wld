Outside Redferne's Residence~
   A huge cloud forms the plateau on which you are now standing.  The
wind here is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly upon you.
From under the cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard.  Right
before you to the north lies the grand Mansion of Naris.

The Southern End Of The Hall~
   You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherever the
light comes from, is a mystery.  The walls seem to radiate warmth and
give the pleasent feeling of being welcome here.  A large portrait is
hanging on one of the walls.  A large wooden staircase leads up into
the tower.  To the east there is a high passage away from the hall.
This ends shortly after by a tall oak door.  The enormous hall extends
further north from here.  To the south you can see a huge, and VERY
heavy-looking iron-wrought door.  It looks like this is the only exit
from this magnificent old house.

Redferne's Library~
   This is truly a magnificent place!  Books and scrolls lie together
on every shelf.  A large globe, with the map of the world upon it,
stands in the dimly lit north-western corner of the room.  Two large
and comfortable looking leather armchairs adorn the center of the
library together with a huge oak desk.  Dim light radiates from an
enormous crystal chandelier hanging down from the ceiling approximately
10 feet off the floor.  To the east there is a great old ashen door.  A
large glass window is set in the west wall.

from the east and go through Midgaard in the middle.

large town with the name 'MIDGAARD' written over it.  The rest is mountains,
woods, plains and water.

The Artifact Room Of Naris~
   This is gloomy and dark room with only a faint light radiating from the
walls.  A bunch of funny-looking items fill the center of the room.  There

through the low steel door.

The Northern End Of The Hall~
   You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall.  This part is
under the grand wooden staircase so the light seems to be a little less
bright here, but this doesn't affect your sight at all.  To the north
lies the kitchen.  To the south lies the southern end of the hall.  To
the east there is a huge metal door.  To the west there is a large
aspenwood door.

most attractive picture is one of a Prince in shining armor.  By one
of the walls there is an old armchair.  The only exit is through the
aspenwood door to the east.

of rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable.  The sound

   This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic
evening.  A large fireplace adorns the east wall, and sizzling away is
the wood that is ablaze within.  The bed is enormous, covering at least
HALF of this great room.  The room stretches at least 140 feet, so can
you imagine the BED?  A large staircase leads down to the hall.  A couple
of doors open up to a broad balcony to the south.

The Chain Where It Is Too Windy~
   Hanging on to the chain you figure out that there is no way of leaving
down from here.  The wind pulls you from left to right and back.  This
seems like a totally impossible task.  The ascend is the only way ahead
for you.  Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground
below.  DO NOT DESCEND NOW OR YOU WILL SURELY DIE!!!!

The Chain~
   As you descend, the chain seems to absorb all weather around it, making
it swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it.  The Chain
seems to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*.  It says 'Welcome back some
other time, stranger.  Your company is always... hmmm... interesting.  God
Speed.'  The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.
