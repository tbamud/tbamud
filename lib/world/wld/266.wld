Edge of the Walkway~
   You have skirted your way right to edge of the path and are now able to get a
good look at what lies below.  Way below.  The 'path' that you thought might
lead down in a zig zag or perhaps in steps is actually a set of stone rungs
notched into the cliff face.  The forest, so far below where you stand looking
down upon it, seems strangely dark, strangely forbidding and very far away.
Maybe it would just be best to forget climbing this ledge.  After all, isn't
Thursday?  Seems like Grainy's in Jareth had a really good dinner special on
Thursdays...  Yeah, that's it.

   The Realm of Lord Ankou by Kaan for Dibrova
aka The Dark and Sinister Forest
This is a forest zone surrounded on all four sides by an unscalable cliff
face.  It is meant to hold four zones Banshide, the Haunted House and the
Castle of the Vampyre.  This is an extremely high level zone, meant for
groups, the mobs are often aggro, Lord Ankou himself drives a band of
spectral minions before his cart which he rides throught the forest, so
players not only have to contend with Ankou as the highest level mob, but
also his minions who will fight for their Lord to the death.  The code for
the minions to follow Ankou can be found on the snippets page. This was
originally intended to connect to the farmlands, at their western-most side
at the chasm.  The lack of a way out of this zone is intentional, just a
little thing to get players stark raving mad when visiting here if they forget
to bring a recall.

Zone 266 is linked to the following zones:
263 Farmlands                      at 26600 (south) ---> 26354
252 Castle of the Vampyre          at 26633 (east ) ---> 25200
252 Castle of the Vampyre          at 26634 (south) ---> 25200
259 Haunted Mansion                at 26643 (west ) ---> 25900
259 Haunted Mansion                at 26647 (south) ---> 25902
259 Haunted Mansion                at 26649 (north) ---> 25906
264 Banshide                       at 26655 (west ) ---> 26400
259 Haunted Mansion                at 26657 (east ) ---> 25904
264 Banshide                       at 26664 (south) ---> 26428
264 Banshide                       at 26665 (north) ---> 26419

   * In room 26659, the reset has moved object 26604 to neck, since there is no
face slot here.  If you have a face slot, this should be moved back to face.

Climbing down the Cliff~
   Standing so near to the top of the walkway, hanging on for dear life, you
realize what a follhearty decision this was to climb this rocky face.  You can
see birds playing below you, almost DIRECTLY below you in the treetops of the
forest so far beneath your feet.  One wrong step, one slip of the hand on the
tenuous handhold you already maintain, and you are birdfeed in the treetops.
Maybe you should just climb up one more step, get off this walkway and call it
all good.

Climbing down the Cliff~
   This climb is going to take forever!  You are still not even halfway down the
cliff and it seems like the closer to the forest you get, the darker and more
forboding it gets.  Not to mention every time you look down, a wave of nausea
racks your body, making you almost lose your grip on the rungs.

Halfway down a 'Trail'~
   Well, here you are - halfway up or down depending on how you look at it.
Your situation has improved a little bit.  It looks like if you fell now, you
would only break a great many bones, rather than just die.  Of course, maybe
dying would be preferable.  You see that the trees below are twisted and
gnarled, all of them seeming more dead than alive.  Sure is encouraging.

Nearing the Forest Floor~
   The forest looms ever closer, ever more dark and sinister.  You can now see
that the birds you saw from up above playing in the treetops were actually
buzzards which seem to constantly circle the treetops everywhere, fighting each
other and anything that trys to get past them.  Looking up, you realize that the
climb ahead would be a real bitch, maybe even impossible.

Tree Top Level - Almost to the Ground~
   The trees that you have begun to descend through seem to try to grab your
feet as you climb down the cliff.  The branches all snag your clothing, sharp
and piercing as you climb down.  The buzzards won't seem to leave you alone and
fighting here is just not what you had in mind when you began your descent.
The forest floor below you, all covered in shadows and mystery, is just a long
jump down, but still a far enough jump that a broken leg or ankle would almost
certainly result in a jumping attempt.

Dark and Sinister Forest~
   The forest around you seems dead, all the trees and their branches seem
withered and brittle.  Strangely enough, with all the lingering death around
you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  The cliff face runs along to
your south, the forest growing right up to the edge and up the edge in some
spots.  There is a set of rungs grooved into the cliff face here.  It looks as
if you may be able to climb up!

you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  North is a deep hollow, one
which looks to hold a great many dark secrets.

It looks very old and very unsafe.

Halfway Up a 'Trail'~
   You find your arms are getting way too tired to keep up the climbing the way
you've been.  The top of the cliff still seems miles away from where you are
now, and there is no spot on this cliff to just stop and take a break.  It might
be a good idea to climb back down, and take your chances in the forest.

Climbing Up the Cliff~
   You simply cannot do it.  Your arms are like jello and your breath is coming
in hot racking gasps that make your palms sweat and your head ache.  You have no
choice but to head back down to the forest and find your way out some other way.

Dark and Sinister Forest~
   The forest around you seems dead, all the trees and their branches seem
withered and brittle.  Strangely enough, with all the lingering death around
you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  The rocky face runs along
north of you preventing any further movement in that direction.

running south and east, keeping you from continuing north or west any farther.

the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  The rock wall makes a curve
here, hemming you in and hindering any movement east or north.  Over time, rocks
have fallen off from the cliffsides and piled up at the base.  A set of small
tracks seem to come and go from beneath two large rocks.

movement to the east.  To the west is a deep hollow, a very large one from the
looks of it although it is hard to tell for sure in this darkness.  Looks almost
like a valley inside this valley.

Dark Tunnel~
   As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see that you are in a tunnel hewn
out of the cliff rockbed.  A feeling in your gut tells you that this tunnel was
not made by ordinary creatures.  Little tracks lead to and from a crude nest
near the tunnel entrance.  A sudden movement catches your eye and you see the
fleeing form of some small creature dashing outside through the rockfall.  You
can explore the tunnel more to the north or head back outside.

Dark Tunnel~
   A think layer of dust covers the hewn floor.  The undisturbed state of things
in the tunnel show that no one has passed through this way in ages.  The stone
walls become more polished and smoother as one progresses northwards.  A faint
odor of incense and spices lingers in the air.

Dark Chamber~
   The tunnel opens up into a small chamber.  The polished walls reflect the
torchlight in an eerie way.  The smell of incense and spices hang heavily in the
air, stiffling you.  A stone slab sits in the middle of the chamber.  Strange
runes adorn the stone slab.  A faded trail of blood upon the slab catches your
eye and you follow the trail to the floor.  There you see that you are standing
in the middle of a pentagram inscribed into the stone floor.  Repressing a
feeling of dread, you get on your knees to study a small indentation in the
middle of the pentagram....

   The runes depict what appears to be the very same stone slab that they are
inscribed upon.  The runes show a manlike being standing before the runes, the
runes glowing fiercely, and then the man gone.

Entrance to another Dimension~
   - The walls of the chamber begin to shimmer brightly.  The outline of the
pentagram catches fire and burns brightly.  The runes on the slab begin to glow
fiercely.  A droning sound begins and intensifies painfully.  Reality seems to
slip away as the room begins to spin around you.  Trying to get a grip on
yourself in this maddening scene, you notice an entryway opening up before you.
