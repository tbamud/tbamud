Entrance to the Tradehalls~
   You're standing in front of a large gateway into the mountain.  The portal
is large enough for several carriages to go through it at once.  It's very nice
masonry work and you can't help thinking about how old it looks.  A sign has
been posted near the entrance.

   On the ground in front of you several blocks, hewn from the sorrounding
rock, have benn spread evenly.  Behind a particularly large and square block,
the stonewrights' assistant has set up a stall, selling large rocks for
headstones and the like.  He also has a selection of smaller stones, refined
into fine jewelry.  To the east you can go back in the main trading hall.

The Armorers Stall~
   You are in the corner of the cave, which the dwarves have decided to use as a
trade area.  In this, the farthest corner from the entrance, some shining armor
has been laid out on an old sack.  Behind it, the assistant to the armorsmith
is getting ready to display his merchandise to you.  To get back to the center
of the trade halls, you must go south.

Center of the Trade Halls~
   You are Standing in the middle of what you would have to call a domed cave,
in lack of other words.  The cave is strangely symmetrical, though, and you are
certain the ceiling high above you have been touched by a dwarfs pickaxe in the
past.  The floor is rock, and there is rock above and around you.  You are also
certain the dwarfs can monitor you here from hidden holes in the rockface.  To
your west and north there are stalls set up by the traders, while to the east
you can try to enter the dwarven city itself.  You can leave to the south.

On a narrow platform~
   You are standing on a narrow platform outside a wooden door.  The platform
has been hewn out of the rock in the northeastern corner of the cave.  There is
only one way onto the platform, and that is from the center of the trade halls.
You feel very exposed as you walk the last couple of feet towards the door.
The door itself is about ten feet wide and fifteen feet tall, making it a huge
portal to the dwarves.  However it is still quite easy to defend, and you
realize they might not want you inside.

   You are standing in a domed cave, which obviously serves as a portcullis.
To your west, a rather large gate opens to the trade halls, and to your east a
smaller stone door blocks your entry into the heart of Aldin.  This cave
obviously has been set up, so the guards have a place to check people before
they leave the trade halls and enter the city itself.  You realize with sudden
brutality the guards are stopping anyone who isn't dwarven...

almost deafened by the sounds from the nearby workshops. It seems all of the
things traded in the trade halls come from these workshops. To your south the
weaponsmith is working and east of here the armor smith is preparing more
armors for sale. You can leave the city by going west from here, or go deeper
into it by heading north.

At Torgs' smithy~
   The dwarves are very proud of their fine weaponry.  Rods of several
different metals have been laid on shelves along the south wall, ready to go
into the forge.  The forege itself has been set in the east wall, accesible
from both here and the armorers smithy just north and east of here.  The walls
are blackened wth soot from many years of smoke from the large forge.  A
strange contraption makes sure the bellows keep the heat at its peak.

forge contraption strange~
   A forge with large leather bellows has been set in the full length of the
eastern wall.  A small stream in the corner makes a small milling wheel turn,
which in turn makes the bellows blow.  It is obvious to you that the reason for
putting the forge here is that small stream.  It runs from a hole in the cave
wall about three feet up, into a hole in the corner.  A small basin suggests the
stream is used to temper the steel in, too.

   Long rods of differently alloyed metal hang here.  On the floor next to them,
bars of lead have been lain down.  Also a barrel sits here, full to the edge

   Just north of here, you can hear the rustle of a large town here beneath the
mountain. The walls around you are made with some of the finest masonry you
have ever witnessed. To your south you can hear the clanging of iron against
iron from the forges, and from your east comes the crisp sound of chisel
against rock. It sounds if someone is making gravestones. To the north a
small portal shields the living areas from the noise of the workshops.

   You are standing in an underground hallway, deep inside the mountain.  The
walls are a show of fine masonry, and the gray marble rocks have been worked so
perfectly, that you wouldn't be able to put even the tip of your knife between
two stones.  Every three feet a torch lights up the corridor and the light
helps you to not think of the terrible weight of the mountain above you.  The
hallway turns a perfect right angle turn to the north and east here.  Perfect
walls block your progress to the west and south.

At Ralfs' smithy~
   Upon entering the smithy you immidiately discover the reason for all the
noise in the area.  All the armors made here are full-body armors.  When
struck by Ralf, they make about as much noise, as a churchbell.  The forge is
set in the south wall, and on the northern and eastern wall, several
half-finished armors have been lain on shelves.  In a crate near the eastern
wall, different straps and thongs of leather are stored - nothing of use until
they've been applied to an armor.

the dwarven mines.  Also the large hole in the floor, with ladders leading into
darkness might have given you a clue.  To your north a wooden door with a
sturdy lock blocks your exit, while you may descend into the mines by going

measures quite large home, a bed has been set along one wall, a table with two
small chairs by another, and a small stove in the farthest corner.  To the east

enough air to enter their city for them to breathe.  The walls are smooth as
only the dwarves can make them, and a strong wind pushes at you from the north.

mistaken - He's not afraid of his fellow dwarves but many men have sworn
against him, since he alone controls the trade of iron and gold from the
dwarven kingdom.  So right now you're standing at the gate to the dwarven
court, waiting to be inspected by the kings' watch.  To your east a large white
marble block serves as a gate and to the east a just as large black granite
slap serves the same purpose.

In a drafty tunnel~
   You're crawling in a small tunnel, leading to the outside from the dwarven
city, or the other way.  North the opening to the outside is very close, while
to the south you can barely make out the light from the torches within the
dwarven city.  A strong draft tries to push you deeper into the tunnel,
pressing on from the north.

In the Mines~
   You are standing on a very steep wooden ladder, and you can't see how far
down there are.  The echoes from below you suggest, however, that you are
perched about halfway up (or down) a drop of several hundred feet.  Around you,
large wooden bracers, probably made from oak, support the mountain walls,
making the journey downwards safe from falling stone.  You may continue up or
down the ladder.

In the mines~
   The ladders continue, both up and down.  Once in a while baskets are lowered
past you into the mine.  Always when one goes down, another goes up, past you.
You stare downwards, hoping to make out some sort of bottom below you.  You
have no such luck.

   You are getting weary.  This ladder seems to go on forever.  Looking up, you
see nothing but darkness, and looking down, nothing more can be seen.  It seems
the ladders aren't so used anymore, since the baskets that are lowered into the
mine can carry more than just gold and rocks.

In the mines~
   Standing on a ladder, inside a huge mountain, you're quite happy the dwarves
seem to have supported their mine well.  Wooden bracers, the size of your leg
support the walls around you.  This helps comfort you a bit, however you are
certain there is a long walk to get to the top of this ladder.  But a very
brief fall to the bottom.  Baskets pass you by sometimes, some with metals,
others with people in them.

   Yuo are standing at the foot of a ladder.  The ladder is made of wooden and
leads up through a large hole in the ceiling.  From the same hole a large
basket is hanging from a thick rope.  Around you is the uneven rockface, you
can't avoid when mining after precious metals.  A ragged opening in the
northern wall leads into the darkness of the mines.  An extremely large basket
is hanging from a rope through the opening in the ceiling.

In the mines~
   Dwarven mines have a tendency to be very much the same all the time, all
stone walls and wooden bracers.  However, at this point you have to be careful.
Just north of here, a deep hole leads into deepest darkness, leaving no doubt
you'd die if you fell in.  A small shelf along the east wall lets you walk
past it, but walk carefully.  The slightest slip would cost you your life.
You may also go south from here.

wall.  But be careful - a fall into the darkness would surely kill you.

   You are walking on a ledge, about three feet wide, on the edge of a very
deep pit.  You walk very close to the east wall, to avoid tripping and falling
into the pit.  While you can't see the bottom of the pit you are certain that
certain death awaits you in the depths.  The ledge continues north and south.

And wait.  Carefully you choose another rock, a bit larger this time, and throw
it in.  Again you wait.  This pit is DEEP.  Don't go there.

   The mine walls has been supported by large wooden bracers here, and as far
as you can see, the dwarves has struck another vein of ore, leading east from
here.  The original tunnel continues north and south from here, while a side
tunnel branches off, following the new vein eastwards.

   You are now inside the very heart of the dwarven kingdom - The mines
themselves.  The mine tunnel in which you're standing has been supported by
bracers made from solid oak.  The face of the rock bears the markings of many a
pick, and the mine continues northward, following the vein deeper into the
mountain.  You may go south too, but tread carefully.

At a dead end in the mines.~
   The mine tunnel ends here.  The ore vein can be seen as a glimmering
vertical stripe at about chest height.  Various mining tools and drills suggest
you've just arrived at a bad time, seeing no one mining the ore.  The tunnel
continues south from here.

   This side tunnel isn't as large as the main mine tunnel just west of here.
Also it twists and turns to follow the ore vein.  The reddish-brown and silvery
white color on the walls suggest an ore with both titanium and iron.  The
tunnel continue south and west from here you see the main tunnel.

tunnel is unsupported and you feel a little unsafe, considering the chance of a
cave-in.  All over the mine floor large rocksa have been left where they fell,
and you feel moreare about to fall down.

In the side tunnels~
   The side tunnel ends here, at an excavation in the south wall.  The dwarves
seem to be mining titanium here.  Since titanium is so strong it is hard on the
tools used, and on the arms swinging the picks.  Currently no one is mining,
but you think it is just a question of time before someone shows up.  A small
bell has been connected to the small pile of ore that's stacked here.  You
immidiately realize that as soon as you touch the pile, the miners will be on
your neck.  The tunnel leads north from here.

   This is where the dwarves get thir iron for the tempered steel plate armors
you saw at the armorers stall in the trade halls.  The ore is so fine you can
actually see the glimmer of iron, not just the reddish lump you see everywhere
else.  The tunnel leads west from here.

   Your scream is stopped suddenly, as you hit the side of the pit,
smashing your skull. Your body continues to fall, for several minutes,
hitting the sides of the pit, until it is reduced to a bloody pulp,
bearing no resemblance to a person.

A small tunnel opens up in the side of the mountain.  The walls are perfectly
smooth and a strong draft at the entrance makes you onder where it all goes.
