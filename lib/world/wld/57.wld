Gemini's Hideaway~
   This appears to be a room belonging to the starsign Gemini (the twins) each
possession has a double, probably so they each have their own things.  One of
the twins doesn't seem to be here right now.  The tracks continue through here
and so does the tail mark even though they are faint and hard to see.

Pisces Lagoon~
   A pool of acid lies in the middle of the floor here, ripples are being
formed by something that is gliding below the surface, wait, TWO THINGS!!!
This is starting to get a little scary, you had better move on...

Leo's Den~
   This room STINKS!  It looks as if it has never been cleaned in its life.
The stench of rotting meat greets your nostrils, escape seems like your only
option at this point in time.  There are exits going down and east.

Taurus's Pen~
   This is the stable of Taurus.  He is an aggresive star sign and should not be
messed with.  The tracks that were on the floor earlier start here again,
covered in faeces.  Whatever walked through here must be regretting it now
because its feet must really reek...

   This shed belongs to Aries the Ram.  Fleece lies all over the floor and the
smell of faeces eminates from a large bucket in the corner.  The ground slopes
away sharply to the east, it looks like it falls away altogether.

The Bloodstained Hallway~
   Like the entrance, this hallway has blood covering just about every part of
it. The animal tracks continue through here, they have three claws, two of
which are to the front and one to the rear. A long mark has been etched into
the roof.

Ursa's Den~
   This is the room of Ursa Major, it is a typical bear cave except stuff has
been piled neatly into a corner.  There is a door leading into a room out back,
it is really dark in there and there are strange noises eminating from inside.
It sounds like a kind of grunting noise, could it be the Bear?

Sagittarius' Temple of Weapons~
   This Temple has weapons lining the walls, possibly every weapon available.
Near the far end of this horrific place stands an altar, and on that altar is
enscribed an archer.  It looks to have the lowerbody of a horse and the torso
of a man.  With sudden realisation you see that is a Centaur!  These creatures
are rarely seen in the wild because they favor seclusion.  The most famous of
these would definitely be Sagittarius the 9th sign of the zodiac.

Yet Another Hallway~
   This is another hallway, the tracks that were on the floor earlier are faint
but still readable.  Following the tracks is a small trail of blood, or what
looks like blood.  It's a bit darker than most blood you've seen as it has more
black in it.  Could this be a trap?

Cancer's Hole~
   This is the hole of Cancer.  Cancer is the 4th sign of the Zodiac and is a
very aggressive carnivore.  She is represented by a crab and her pincers are
extremely deadly, so deadly they could cut a persons head off by merely running
them along a persons neck.  Be warned, this is a place of death.

ZodiaShop~
   This is where you may buy the items of the Zodiac.  The shopkeeper is a
stubbornn fellow and rather fat, he is usually seen with his head on the
counter drooling over Starsigns like Virgo and the female Gemini twin.  Most
classify him as weird.

Virgos' Bedroom~
   This bedroom is lavishly furnished.  Almost everything is blue and gold but
there are also hints of red and orange.  All the metal work is made with
copper.  There is a large double bed in one corner, it looks to be made out of
solid oak, there is also a table and chairs.  The roof is covered with a star
chart, certain parts are glowing dimly.  The most brightly shining sign on the
chart appears to be Scorpio.  How very strange.

The Muddy Tunnel~
   This is a pigsty compared to the cleanliness of the last room.  Mud and muck
squelches underfoot, it reeks worse than Leos' room, and that is something to
be said.  There is a faint glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.  Exits
face north and south towards the light.

Nearing the end of the muddy hall~
   The southern end of this hallway is lighter than the rest, probably because
of the light coming from the portal in front of you.  The portal has the color
of blood, deep red.  Looking through it seems to go on forever although there
is a bright green spot in the distance.

Entering the Ethereal Void~
   The color red fills your vision, except for way off to the south (is it
south??  ) where the speck of green seen from outside this place has grown to
the size of a fingernail.  Sounds of the ocean fill what otherwise would be
silence.  This place is kind of spooky but peaceful.

Floating in the Ethereal Void~
   The green speck from before is the size of a doorway now, this portal seems
to stretch the limits of space and time.  Red fills the eyes and a chilly wind
has started to blow through the doorway.  Through the door there looks to be a
mountain valley, and by the sounds of it there is a herd of goats as well.

Exit from the Portal~
   Upon exiting from the red portal a mountain pass comes into view.  The
bleating from the goats echoes through here and makes a terrible din.  In the
distance there is a faint gold colored sparkle, maybe two.  Large hills,
possibly small mountains stretch up to the east and west and they have snow
covered peaks.  There are exits north back into the portal and south into the
pass.

In the Pass~
   This pass serves as defense for the valley beyond.  If anything evil decides
to come through the portal the goat herd raise the alarm and an impenetrable
mist descends upon the valley thwarting any attempt to lay siege to it.

Entrance to the valley~
   Lush green grass covers the ground of this valley.  There are goats
scattered across the pastures nibbling here and there, bleating and headbutting
each other.  At the far end stands Capricorn, on his head is what you saw
before, golden horns.  There are a few trees dotted throughout the valley and
goats are standing under them sleeping and just lazing about.  Rivers
criss-cross the valley and at the far end is a waterfall.  Exits lead back into
the pass and down into the valley.

In the valley of Capricorn~
   A large valley stretches before the eye.  The grass is deep and springy and
the smell of fresh mountain air greets thy nostrils.  There are large mountains
surrounding this valley and young goats are climbing around on the foot of the
large one near the far end.  These goats are drinking from the pool of water at
the bottom of the waterfall.  Exits lead east and west toward groups of goats
and and west, further into the valley.  Of course there is also and exit back
into the pass.

Ascending the Hill of Capricorn~
   The soft springy grass gives way to a path here, at the top sits Capricorn
the 10th sign of the zodiac.  Bones litter the ground around him, most are
skulls and spines.  Those strange tracks from before are here and they are more
discernable.  What could they mean?

Capricorns' Hill~
   Here sits Capricorn, one of the signs of the zodiac.  Huge stone slabs form
a couch where the lord of the goats rests, and thick moss cushions his head.
The air is fetid with the smell of the dead.

Descending towards the Waterfall~
   Just to the north is a massive waterfall.  From the looks of it, it falls
about 300 feet!  Behind the lower part of of it there seems to be a cave.  A
faint glow can be seen inside.  Whatever could it be?

Under an Oak Tree~
   Under this tree is a small grouping of goats.  They look to be males from
all their headbutting and grunting.  This tree is very large and stripes that
have been scored into the tree form a ladder.  Tree sap oozes down the ladder
and it has a sweet smell.  Little red eyes can be seen up the ladder.

here and into a hole at the back of the cave.  The hole is very large and
dirty, bones surround the entrance.  Where do they go?

   This tunnel is short but dark.  At the far end it opens up into an extremely
large room.  In the center a fire burns and the tracks stop at the far end in
front of a large throne.  Shadows caused by the fire dance across the tunnels
walls making eerie shapes.  Your adventure looks to be almost finished.

anticipation of his next meal which is squirming behind his throne.  It's
Virgo!  That sleazy freak has zodianapped her!  It's time someone taught him a
lesson.

It is plain to see that the owner of this place was a female because of all the
portraits of male Nymphs on one of the branches that obviously serves as a
mantlepiece.
