Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.

Connector Zones: Beach and Lighthouse, McGintey Bay
This is a fairly large sea made strictly for the purpose of connecting
new continents and islands to the MUD. The mobs have little eq as most
of them are fish or other sea-faring animals. This zone can add a
great deal of openings for builders to add to the overall theme of the
MUD.
Zone 319 is linked to the following zones:

Calm Waters~
   The calm sooth mind and body, lending a feeling of peace and comfort to any
traveler who passes.  The waves roll gently by, the ocean seeming harmless and
worry-free.  A sandy beach lies just to the north, running along the length of a
steep cliff face.

Calm Waters~
   The water is a gently rolling calm here that seems to go on forever.  The sky
and the water match almost exactly, so blue the water and so clear the sky.  A
steep cliff face rises up to the north, opening up east of here into a bay.

A Choppy Section of the Sea~
   The water has grown tumultous and rough here, the waves not high but
frequent.  Water splashes into the air as the small waves spalsh into each
other.  McGintey Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this
angle the city itself can be seen.

A Choppy Section of the Sea~
   The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn a bit,
the water bobbing and jumping rapidly.  Every now and again a small fish can be
seen jumping up from the wake, searching for food on the surface.  McGintey
Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
itself can be seen.

Placid Waters~
   The sea has turned to calm that is almost unsettling.  Any sailor would bow
their head and say a quick prayer to the Sea God at this time to pray for a wind
of some sort.  Looking in all directions, the sea is still and quiet.  McGintey
Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
itself can be seen.

never once having the desire or need to get up and work.

Wild, Foaming Crests~
   The water rises and falls with such force that it seems the world must be
shaking on its foundations.  The water splashes and crashes against itself, foam
and froth all over the surface of the sea.  The sea is dashed again and again
against the rock face of a cliff on the north side.  To the west a huge opening
in the cliff can be seen, opening into a large bay.
