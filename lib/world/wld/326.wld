Trampled Dirt Highway~
   The road that led to McGintey Cove has been left behind, widened into what
can only be called a highway.  From the amount of tracks made from countless
wagon wheels, hooves of horses and mules and the boots of hundreds of feet you
can see that all different sorts have passed this way, probably more than once.
You follow your gaze eastward along the highway, but you cannot see its end from
where you now stand.

   The highway continues its way eastward toward what must be a very highly
populated area.  The cliff that the road ran along back near McGintey Cove has
ended, the road veering slightly northward into the deep forest which will soon
surround you.  You sense nothing threatening in the direction you travel,
however one can never be too sure.

   You are now entered into a forest area, thick with trees and bracken which
would bar your way through the forest should you attempt to cut through without
following a path.  To the north of you is a trail into the forest, only visible
because it is a break in the trees.  The trail itself is nearly completelt
covered in leaves.  The highway continues to the east and west.

   The highway heads east and west, veering slightly northward as it heads east.
You are constantly amazed by the amount of traffic that passes by you, the dust
from all the passing people almost annoying.  To the north is a small, leaf
covered trail heading into the thick forest.

   The highway veers sharply northward here, heading deeper into the forest,
away from what you know as the civilized world.  There must be some sort of
civilization, however, that this highway leads to, otherwise it would not be so
well travelled.  To the south is a small path in through the trees of the
forest.

   The way has been flooded over and turned to mud and sludge here, as a river
flows through the center of the highway just north of here.  From all the hooves
and boots which have passed through the river and head south, the water has
saturated into hard packed dirt of the highway and turned it to slippery mud.
Best to watch your step.

Trampled Dirt Highway~
   A small branch of a local river runs through the highway, making it so that
you will have to get your feet wet.  It is not deep in the slightest, only a
couple feet at the deepest point, however is does make you have to watch your
step.  The highway itself has been reinforced with a small stones so as not to
wash out and turn into a gorge, however there are only so many stones and in
many spots the road has turned to mud.  You may head east or south along the
highway or west onto a barely visible trail through the forest.

   The road is extremely wet and turned to mud in many places from the water
which clings to most feet, wheels and hooves which pass this way and head east.
Just to the west is a river crossing, north is a dirt trail through the forest,
and east the highway continues.

   You see a huge clearing in the forest just to east of here, what appears to
be a valley, as you can see only blue sky past a certain point in that
direction.  Some sort of gate has been erected over the highway, disallowing
passage eastward, apparently unless permission is given by the one or both of
the two guards which stand at post in front of the gate.  There is a small path
through the forest just to the south of here.

Camp Perimeter~
   You stand at the crest of a large valley which is home to a huge military
encampment.  It appears that this must be a well-funded installation as there
are so many memebers of this army even at peace-time.  You might head east into
the valley to see what sort of army this is, if not for the gate blocking your
way and the two guards which stand solemnly at attention awaiting to see your
pass.  You may walk the perimeter to the north or south, around the crest of the
valley, but that might not be wise to pursue to any long-term degree as the
archers towers that line the perimeter seem to have been designed for sight
see-ers just like yourself.

   You follow along the perimeter of the camp, a wide wagon trail which
encircles the entire valley.  A barbed wire mesh runs along the roadside,
preventing entry into the valley through conventional means.  One could probably
pass through the barbed wire with a small scattering of abrasions, but not
before archers and crossbowmen from the guard turrets which also line the road,
cut one down while flailing in the wire.  Probably it is best to follow along
the road and seek other means of entry.

   The barbed wire mesh which encircles the whole of the valley give you pause
to think that maybe you had best gain entry through civilized means rather than
trying to force your way through and risk getting cut or hurt on the wire.  Of
course, getting cut on wire would actually pale in comparison to getting shot
with an arrow or bolt from one of the guard turrets which line the crest of the
valley.

Forest Path~
   The path runs through the forest, branching in a number of directions here.
The feeling that you are being watched is stronger than ever.  Possibly from the
trees...

Forest Path~
   The sounds of the army and the people in the valley are completely swallowed
by the looming trees of this thick forest.  You feel immediately isolated and
alone, and very vulnerable.  In fact, you could almost swear that you were being
watched.

Path Through the Trees~
   As you leave the open air of the wagon trail behind and enter into the
forest, you are immediately struck by the silence that the forest has captured.
With the foliage so thick, no sound travels through the trees at all, save for
the occasional creak of a tree as it sways or the skitter of a chipmunk.  A
strange feeling of being watched also pervades the area.

Path Through the Trees~
   This is a dead-end in the trail, best to just head back toward the wagon
trail.  Especially now that the sensation of being watched is stronger than
ever.  Kind of creepy.

watching always just behind you or over your shoulder.

Path Through the Trees~
   The forest itself seems cheery enough, although a bit overgrown so as to
prevent any progress save that offered by the trail.  However, you get the
strangest feeling that you are being watched, perhaps from the trees...

   The path leads through the trees deep into the forest.  You may head south
deeper into the trees or north back out onto the wagon trail.

Faint Path Through the Forest~
   This seems to be more of a deer run than a path, although upon inspection of
the trail, you do see the mark of booted feet having traveled this way.  The
forest immediately surrounds you, placing you in an entirely different
surrounding that of what you grew accustomed to along the wagon trail.

   You are immediately swallowed up by the forest, all sound and feel of open
air has been replaced by a stuffy, isolated feeling.  The trail heads north or

Faint Path Through the Forest~
   You have reached a dead-end in the path.  Your only choice is to turn back
the way you came, the forest is just simply too thick to pass through without
having a trail to follow.  You feel eyes upon you as you turn around and prepare
to head back the way you came.  Perhaps someone in the trees...?

Logging Area~
   You stand amidst an array of stumps and burnt grass, piles of timber lying
everywhere.  At the edges of the area, where the army has not yet gone into to
cut down these trees, lies stacks and stacks of shorn tree trunks, the limbs and
bows all cut from them to form perfect logs.

Logging Area~
   You walk among the broken tree stumps, the idea that where you now stand was
once a strong, thriving forest which towered high above your head only a vague
realization.  It is almost impossible to believe that there were ever trees
here, even though the litter of stumps all over the ground tells otherwise.

Logging Area~
   The trees here have been cut recently, you can still smell the drying sap in
the air and the dust that the axes create when striking the trees so hard.  You
see just north of here an area where it appears the army has cut into within the
last month or less - it does not seem as finalized of an area as the rest of
this does.

strong and thick, where the army has not yet worked their way into.

Logging Area~
   You stand at the northwest corner of the area that has been cleared away from
the forest by the army's loggers.  Neat rows of logs twice as tall as you line
along the forest's edge to your west, unbroken forest to your north.

A Large Stump~
   This small area holds only one single stump.  This would be odd in itself
since the area al around it is so filled with trees, but the stump itself is as
big around as a house.  It appears that the tree that used to stand here was
most probably one of the oldest in the forest and because of its immensity kept
the area around from growing up too much, its roots alone must have crowded any
other growth away.

Wide Trail~
   The trail picks up from the wide trail at the other side of the valley, just
as if there were no huge camp seperating the two sections of road.  This side
seems just as well traveled as its western counterpart, wagon tracks and
hoofprints galore.  The camp is off just west of here, the road follows through
the forest to the east.

Wide Road~
   The road continues through to the east and west.  Off to the east you see the
faint sheen of smoke on the horizon, as is common with most large towns.  To the
west is the encampment of the Eastern Army.

Wide Road~
   The forest is beginning to thin somewhat, the trees becoming more sparse
giving way to small fields of tall grass and sporatic copses of trees.  The
signs of traffic are becoming more and more abundant the farther to the east
that is traveled.
