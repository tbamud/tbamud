In the Desert~
   You work your way through the golden dunes of sand.  The only evidence of
life is the tracks you leave behind.  A gusting wind throws sand up into your
face and makes you choke.  On the horizon you believe you can see a clump of
trees.

In the Desert~
   The world around you is obscurred by a small dust devil.  The blowing sand
and slippery footing makes travel in this desert painful.  To the southeast you
can make out a few trees and some small shrubbery.  A good sign of water.  You
are thirsty.

Between Sand Dunes~
   You work your way between sand dunes.  As you climb the top of one you can
see nothing but desert stretching for miles in every direction.  You find it
very hard, if not impossible, to remember which direction you are heading.

Beside the Oasis~
   As you climb to the top of another dune you can see the small oasis just to
the south.  A cluster of tall palm trees reach toward the sky.  It is the only
landmark for miles around and it is from this landmark that many travellers
find their way to the lost city and the south pass.  You can faintly make out a
trail leading east and west.

Between Sand Dunes~
   You step into a valley between two large sand dunes, the wind here is
bearable and you can breathe without swallowing a handful of sand.  The desert
is very peaceful here.  You notice some bleached white bones half-buried in the
sand.

On a Sand Dune~
   You can just barely make out a small path leading to the east.  The path
seems to be the remains of a small stream that dried up years ago.  You have
heard that you can follow a stream and it will eventually lead to civilization.
Maybe this will lead to somewhere important.

A Sandy Path~
   The wind is calmer here, allowing you to discern the small trail a little
better.  The sand you walk on seems to be firming up slightly and you can see a
few cactii further to the east as you work your way out of the harshest part of
the desert.

In the Desert~
   You become confused as to which direction you were heading.  You glance back
to trace your footsteps, but the wind has already covered them over.  You get
an uneasy feeling in your stomach as you realize how easily one could get lost
here.

In the Desert~
   The wind and sand tear at every bit of your clothing and exposed flesh.
You try to cover your face but the sand still finds its way in.  You remember
stories of lost travellers entering the desert and never returning.  Will you
be next?

In the Desert~
   The golden sands of the desert would almost be peaceful if it wasn't for the
extreme heat during the day and frigid cold at night.  It is a wonder that any
animal could survive out here, but some do.  Most animals living in the desert
are scavengers who prey on lost souls, like your own!

Beside the Oasis~
   You find yourself just west of the oasis.  It is from there that people
travel between the lost city, south pass, and the Capital.  This is where the
truly adventureous travelers roam in the search for fame and fortune.  Most
never make it back.

The Oasis~
   A clump of palm trees surround a small desert spring.  This is where an
underground river comes to the surface of the desert.  A tiny bit of dank water
trickles through the center of the palms.  It is not very refreshing, but
enough to support a flurry of plant and animal life.  From here paths continue
north toward the Capital or the lost city, and south to the south pass.

Beside the Oasis~
   To the east you see the oasis where travellers can rest and drink from the
small trickle of water that never runs dry.  This oasis is a safe haven for
many lost travellers.  From the oasis a lost traveller can usually find his way
back to safety.

A Sandy Path~
   Small Cactii flourish here.  You even see a few dried out shrubs that
somehow survive without water for months at a time.  Small animals that have
adapted to the extreme weather in the desert scurry away as you pass.  Tales of
deadly scorpions make you watch where you step.

A Rocky Path~
   The path you are following is full of small pebbles and rocks.  The sand has
been washed away in this area making a small ditch where a good sized stream
must have once flowed.  The ground around the ditch is packed sand with cracks
running through it.

The Desert~
   Dunes obscure your vision for more than fifty feet in any direction.  As you
climb to the top, expecting to get a better view of your surroundins, you only
see more dunes.  The dry air makes you wish you had remembered to bring more
water.

The Desert~
   The sky above you is completely clear, no matter the time of day there is
not enough moisture in the desert to form any clouds.  The area around you is
barren, just sand, no sign of any life.  To the northeast you can see what
looks like some trees in the distance.

The Desert~
   The heat is oppressive and drains all energy from your body.  The hot sand
under your feet makes it difficult to even walk.  Just to the north is a small
patch of palm trees.  A place of sanctuary in the middle of an ocean of sand.

A Rocky Path~
   The ditch is close to ten spans across now.  Large boulders litter the
bottom of what must have once been an impressive river.  Skeletons of fish are
half buried in the rubble.  It appears this stream ran dry from an unnatural
cause.  The banks of the river reach up to about eye level.

A Dried Up River Bed~
   You find yourself trapped inside this natural canyon.  The banks tower above
your head, actually slanting towards you, making them impossible to climb.
The rocky river bed makes an unsure footing and you stumble along, trying not
to twist an ankle.  The river bed leads in an east west direction.

begin to notice bones scattered among the rocks that don't look like fish
bones.

horizon.  Maybe it is just a mirage, or maybe it is something else.  The harder
you look the more you begin to think that you might be reaching the southern
end of the desert.

A Dried Up River Bed~
   The banks of the river bed are made of some type of solid sandstone, worn
smooth from years of errosion from the river.  Now they are becoming pitted and
cracked.  The river bed continues north and east.

A Dried Up River Bed~
   The wind howls as it gets caught in between the banks of what used to be a
large river.  The banks reach up to just above your head, obscuring your view
of what's above you.  The river bottom is layered in small round pebbles.
This would be a great place to set up an ambush for unwary travellers.

   The sky overhead is clear.  A strong wind from the south buffets you
relentlessly.  You can make out what looks like a mountain range further to the
south.  Perhaps this faded trail you are following leads to the south pass.

A Trail~
   To the north, east and west, a desert of shimmering sand stretches for as
far as you can see.  To the south a jagged mountain range stretches to the sky.
The mountains are tall enough to be barren of trees and some are even snow
capped.

   To the south you can see a tall, jagged mountain range.  The stories of the
range are wild and undoubtedly false.  But one thing you know is true.  They
are almost insurpassable unless you can find the south pass.  The trail leads
east and west.

desert sand.  Dunes of sand rise above you to the south and east.  The trail
continues to the west.  This part of the desert is strangely quite and still.

to the north.  Anyone or anything could easily hide along the base of the
mountains.  A small trail leads to the east.  An almost invisible trail leads
south from here, toward the mountains.

clearing just to the north.

that you are not the only one enjoying this peaceful grove.
