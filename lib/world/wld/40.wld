The Hills~
   You are on a path leading north, small hills surround you.
You feel the forces of evil approach you from the north.  Off
in the distance to the northeast you can see the beginning of
a large mountain range.

you are some threatening hills.  A small trail leads up the hillside
through the rocks to a dark cave located to the north.  Off to the

mountain range.

The Cave~

the widest point and about forty feet long.  Off to the south you
sense fresh air and you surmise that the entrance must be located
off in that direction.  To the north a small tunnel continues into
the mountain.

The Maze~
   You stand in yet another small and damp tunnel.  The ceiling hangs
quite low overhead and the passage twists off into darkness.  The only
exits from here look to be off to the east and north.

The Tunnel~
   You stand in a small chamber beneath the earth.  The chamber
closes down to tunnel size to the west as the only obvious exit
leads away in that direction.  Before heading off that way, you
decide to look around the cave.  The walls are slightly damp to
the touch, and the ceiling is very smooth.  Almost right in the
center of the ceiling, a well rounded hole has been made.

   You stand in yet another small and damp tunnel.  The ceiling hangs
quite low overhead and the passage twists off into darkness.  The only
exits from here look to be off to the east and north.  To the north,
you can see the entrance to what looks to be a large and well lit cave.

   You stand in yet another small and damp tunnel.  The ceiling hangs
quite low overhead and the passage twists off into darkness.  The only
exits from here look to be off to the east, south, and north.  To the
south, the tunnel looks to open up into a cavern.

The Large Cave~
   You find yourself in what is perhaps the largest cave you
have ever been in.  It stretches through the darkness to the
east and south.  The cave is nigh filled with echoes created
by the sound of your breathing.  Stalactites and stalagmites
hang down from the ceiling and climb upwards from the ground
of the cavern respectively.

The Tunnel~
   You stand in a narrow tunnel.  It makes a turn from east to south
here as it heads through the rock of the mountain.  The western wall
of the tunnel looks to have broken through a small, natural crack in
the rock to lead into what appears to be a fairly large cave.

The End Of The Tunnel~
   The tunnel comes to a sudden halt here.  How very bizarre.  The
only exit is back to the west, where the tunnel leads back through
the mountain.  There is absolutely nothing of any interest down at
the end of this passageway either.  How odd.

The Hole~
   You are at a small hole in the floor.  Alas, you can only leave
north because to leave down into the unknown, you must be able to
fit through the hole, which is far too small for you!

The Copse Of Trees~
   Standing in this copse of trees gives you an eerie feeling.  Off to
the east you can see the plains, and just to the north a strange shadow
seems to be changing shape constantly and almost seems to beckon you to
enter it.

On A Mountain Trail~
   You find yourself on a mountain trail twisting down towards a small
hidden valley located in the shadow of another mountain a short distance
to the east.  The trail is fairly rough going and looks to dip down into
the small valley before climbing up the side of the other mountain.  As
you look at the valley from a closer vantage point, you realize that it
is much smaller than you had expected, being maybe thirty feet long.  It
is quite surprising how deceptive distances can be this high up in the
mountains, isn't it?

In The Hidden Valley~
   This valley seems to be a complete waste of a climb down the
mountainside.  Of course, there is always the carefully hidden
trail that you just noticed on the eastern side of the valley,
leading up the eastern mountain that is blocking most of the sky
from you.

In The Hidden Valley~
   This small valley is hidden away in the shadow of the large
mountain to the east.  The trail leading up it to the east seems
to vanish before your eyes, but you are quickly able to find it
once again.  A trail leads up the mountain to the west as well.
