Footpath Through Leper's Village~
   The ground here is well-trampled, the trod of many feet evident in the way
the thick grasses are pushed back to the ground.  A small scattering of huts lie
to the east, some of them very small - obviously single person occupied - others
are a bit more large with space for more than a few.  To the north a way leads
through the thick jungle which covers most of the top of this island.

Connector Zones: Yllythad Sea
This is a fair-sized island out in a secluded part of the sea which is
populated by lepers who have been banished or thrown out of their
homeland. This was mainly built as a good place for high levels to get
experience. The few objects that are there are meant to be fairly
good in stats, as this zone was built to be difficult.
Zone 312 was linked to the following zones:
102 The Dream Halls - Hiruma       at 31265 (west ) ---> 10234

looks to have a capacity of at least three to four people.  Ways through the
small village lie to the east and south both of them seeming just as gloomy and

those that there are are kept in order and quite tidy.  A small row of beds lie

number of people judging from their size, however with the lack of people in
evidence it is tough to judge whether or not those huts actually have any
inhabitants.  To the east is a small fenced-in pig pen with a couple of warty,
dirty wild boars who glare balefully at any who pass.

   This small hut holds only the bare essentials and no more.  It appears that
the lepers who get left on this island are left with nothing more than the
clothes on their back, as most of the dwellings in this place are much the same
- without decor or appeal.

Chicken Coop~
   This small and stuffy building never holds any more than five chickens at a
time.  These chickens are brought in from the supply floats which are left by
the passing ships which drop supplies on a biweekly basis per the Lord of
Jareth's orders.  Everytime new chickens are brought in by way of ship, the best
are kept to produce eggs while all others over the number of five are
slaughtered and used as community meat.

path continues however it is much less traveled and is immediately engulfed in
the massive trees of the island jungle.  To the south is a small hut made from
clay and rough timbers, north is another such hut but much larger and with a
cross affixed to the outer wall just right of the door.  This must obviously be
the chapel for the village.

way into a small community of huts nestled in a clearing in the jungle.

that if one were to be wandering along this path late at night there would be no
way to wander off and get lost in the jungle.

grease or oily grime.

A Tepid Pond~
   The water of this small inland pool is rank and oily, as if sprung from a vat
of noxious chemicals.  A faint glaze lies across the surface of the pond, the
slime of dirt and grime from the diseased people which use this water.

Encampment~
   The first sight that greets your eyes as you enter into this open area is
that of the towering volcano, a presence that cannot be ignored.  The crest
roils with a constant flow of black smoke, a low grumble more felt than heard
from its deep innards.  Camped directly at the base is a small cluster of
dwellings, actually only two dwellings and a rickety-looking pen which holds
barely a-livestock.

Encampment~
   This is the center of the dirty little camp that barely scratches out a life
of servitude at the base of the volcano, inside of which the Eternal Fire burns.
To the west is the edge of the isle, where a cliff makes a steep drop-off down
to the white sand beaches at the shore of the sea.  East a ways there is a small
log pen for any livestock that might get given to these poor folk by the
healthier lepers in the village south of here.

Open Dirt Area~
   East of here is a long, low hut made from clay and rough timber.  It looks to
be in pretty bad shape, many holes evident in the roof and walls.  Flies buzz
about this area, making an annoying buzz.  Most probably they are attracted by
the stink of the animal pen to the southeast and the hut to the east.

Dirt Area~
   The ground has been trampled away to a dirty, half mud glop that sticks to
shoes as they trod through.  To the east is a snall pen which holds the meager
livestock given these people by the more needy people living to the south.
North is a large hut, almost large enough to be called a hall, a set of steps
leading up and into the interior.  South is small open area with a pile of ash
in the center.

Community Gathering Area~
   There is a central firepit here where most nights the inhabitants that can
still move about come to be together.  Not much talking goes on and certainly no
dancing, however the idea of being together - nearby another human - sometimes
is all it takes to give the comfort needed by these doomed people.

Grubby Animal Pen~
   There is not much to tell about this disgusting little animal holding area.
It looks as if the people who maintain this place are not very particular about
seperating their livestock, there are droppings from many different kinds of
animals from pig to chicken to unidentifiable.  The entire affair is ringed by a
set of logs from the trees of the jungle, tied loosely at the corners.

   The log flooring of this hut is so grubby that the color of the logs appear
almost discolored.  The walls are made of the same logs stacked, tied and mudded
together in a very loose, haphazard fashion.  The leaf and thatch roof of this
place has many small holes and is even missing entirely in some places.

The House of Death~
   Aptly named by the unwilling inhabitants of this small community, this dirty
place is where the people who have progressed past the point of help are kept
until they die or beg to be tossed into the Eternal Flame.  The smell of dead or
rotting skin has been so long in this place that even when no one is lying amid
the soiled blankets that litter the floor, the smell of the rotteed flesh still
lingers.

The Base of the Volcano~
   A set of log steps have been set into the outer rock wall of the volcano,
leading up to the smouldering top where dark bursts of smoke blow forth in
irregular spurts.  The pathetic excuse for an encampment crouches pitifully in
the presence of this volcano, a constant reminder that sooner or later anyone
living here will be one with the Eternal Flame which burns within.

Trail to the Volcano's Crest~
   The logs have been moored into the hard rock of the volcano, allowing the
ascent to be a bit less arduous.  Built by men and women who were breathing what
was most probably some of their last breaths, those men and women made it so
that future generations would not have to labor so long or hard to consecrate
the bodies of fallen friends to the volcano and the Eternal Flame within.

the climb a bit less effort.  Being that most of the men and women who climb
this trail are living their last days in pain and misery, this path was made
with their incapabilities in mind.

Smoking Crest of the Volcano~
   Into the pit, the Eternal Flame.  That is where all who live upon this island
in exile end up in the end.  Blessed by the priest who stands ready at all times
to serve his fellow man, one may be thrown or voluntarily jump into the Flame at
any time.  It is never contested by any who dwell upon the island whether or not
the timing is right for the one who is jumping, it is simply accepted that that
person has had enough of the disease and horror that is leprosy.

cliff wall which prohibits travel after a distance.  The sand here is very
clean, very white - almost bleached.  It is a very fine sand that makes walking
a bit more of an effort than normal packed beach sand, however it makes fro such
beautiful scenery that it is not unpleasant at all.

   The sand is a fine, almost soft white color that looks to have been bleached
by the sun over the years.  This short section of beach runs along the shoreline
of the island north to south.  To the north, the way gets blocked by a volcano's
wall which rises from the sea high into the sky.  Just south from this locale is
a cliff wall, one which cuts off both south and eastward travel as it is
certainly too steep to climb.

   A small rivulet of water is all that flows down this narrow gulley toward the
sea below.  It is possible to wade through in the water's course, as it is only
a few inches deep at its deepest point.  Just up the hill a bit is the pond from
this water emanates.  Through a tangle of bracken and jungle foliage, the
trickle flows downhill toward the waiting sea.

sea, running down in a light but steady flow.  Jungle foliage encroaches on both
sides, making the way quite cramped, sometimes only allowing passage to one who
would turn sideways to pass.

   A beach of bleached white sand runs from north to south along the coast of
this small isle.  To the north and south is a steep cliff which rises high above
the sea level at least fifty feet, making both directions impassable after only
a very short distance.  A flow of water runs from a small overgrown gully just
west of here, making its way down a small four inch sand canyon down into the
sea.

   The sand of the beach is very fine, bleached white almost to the point of
beauty.  Looking high up into the heights of the isle, jungle foliage can be
seen growing in abundance.  No signs of habitation are visible, although black
smoke continues to rise in constant puffs from somewhere on the isle.  Of
course, it could simply be the volcano that was visible from the sea.

   Nothing has been done to this small place to make it any more habitable than
it was the day it was found and taken as a home.  The walls are quite natural,
the interior of a tree which grew a bit different from its brothers of the
jungle, having a hollow base.  The floor is of the soft dirt of the jungle,
covered in dried jungle leaves that may have blown in years ago and turned
brittle with age.  No blankets lie upon the ground - the only change from
nature's intent here is the small firepit which glows red in the center of this
place.
