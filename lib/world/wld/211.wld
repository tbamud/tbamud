Parna's Tarot Zone Description Room~
   This area is trying to recreate the Tarot zone I built for Smaug.  The
purpose is to have a way of Tarot fortune-telling online.  It has been repeated
twice to allow different people to have their futures told at the same time.
It's a specialized sort of area that, in my experience, most people will stay
away from, some people will visit occasionally and a few people may visit
constantly.  There is, of course, no way of telling what the ratio will be on
any given mud.

   If you have diagonal exits, please remove the corner rooms and use the
diagonal exits instead.

   There are a lot of triggers to try to keep people from blocking the zone.
Please adjust these to your own mud.

   The food and drink in room 21102 are self replicating.  For each bokolyi or
glass taken, another one appears.  If you don't like this, just take them out.
This is mainly for zone testers so they won't starve or dehydrate while they're
reading the cards but it's a convenience to low-levels with no money, too.

   I think it should be attached to the main town.  Since Midgaard is the recall
town here, room 3121 heading north into 22001 seems like a reasonable spot with
perhaps an addition of the mention of a house to the north.

Outside a small building~
   A tidy-looking three-story building made of red brick waits invitingly for
customers.  The yard is a peaceful square space with a neat picket fence
protecting the green lawn from the street while not blocking the view of the
house.  Bright flowerbeds snuggle against the foot of the fence.  A bright brass
sign is placed near the door.
