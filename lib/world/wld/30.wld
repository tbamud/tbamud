The Temple Of Midgaard~
   You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing Gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
To the west, you see the Reading Room.  The donation room is in a small
alcove to your east.

PETSHOP STOREROOM~
   Make two rooms and some pets.  The rooms MUST be sequential.  If the first
room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.

The Great Field Of Midgaard~
   You are walking on a wide dirt path through the lush, green, fresh
Midgaard countryside.  You can see to the horizon to the north, east,
and west; the busy city of Midgaard lies to the south.  All around you
is healthy green grass and an occasional large oak tree.  The sun feels
wonderful on your face and a pleasant wind blows through your hair.  Birds
chirp quietly to themselves and you can smell the faint scent of flowers
and freshly cut grass.  You feel like you could lie down in the grass and
stay here forever, surrounded by powerful beauty in all directions.
