The Great Field Of Midgaard~
   You are walking on a wide dirt path through the lush, green, fresh
Midgaard countryside.  You can see to the horizon to the north, east,
and west; the busy city of Midgaard lies to the south.  All around you
is healthy green grass and an occasional large oak tree.  The sun feels
wonderful on your face and a pleasant wind blows through your hair.  Birds
chirp quietly to themselves and you can smell the faint scent of flowers
and freshly cut grass.  You feel like you could lie down in the grass and
stay here forever, surrounded by powerful beauty in all directions.

     I originally decided to make this zone a place to connect new zones
     north of Midgaard. Later on, I decided to add a ski hill and under-
     ground temple. This zone contains about 100 rooms, 3 shops, 1 death
     trap, several new items, and a bunch of new mobs. In a small cave at
     the southernmost part of the zone is a locked room, guarded by a
     mob. Inside the room is the "Belt of the Ancients", a good piece of
     equipment. You might want to check out the difficulty of the mob
     guarding the belt and ensure that he's strong enough for your MUD.
     You don't want players gettting good equipment too easily! :)

     Written entirely from scratch in WordPad. Feel free to edit, modify,
     and do what you want with this zone!
