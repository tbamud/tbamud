Detta's [Spider Swamp] Description Room~
    @BTheme:@n This zone is a recreation of the Spider Swamp within
Forgotten Realms (Dungeons & Dragons). It is basically a hot, fetid
swampland inhabited with spiders, bullywugs, and lizardfolk, with a
submerged palace called Lost Ajhuutal in the Northern part.
Have made liberal use of exit/extra descrips here, so examine at will. :)
   @GPlayers:@n Geared towards mid/high level players of around 15-20,
there are smaller mobs to kill here if you feel like braving the aggressive
stronger ones ;-). It is also a fairly evil area, with some limitations on what
you can use and access as a good player here. Some equipment/money to be
gained, big bad guy to be slaughtered, and lots of xp.
   @RLocation:@n Well the area itself is completely swampish, though at the
southern part it could easily be joined to a river or lake, and a more foresty
area would blend seamlessly into the eastern area.
   @MSecrets:@n Yes there are some :-), type LOOK SPOILERS to reveal all.
   @CNote:@n If you have any suggestions, spot any typos, bugs, or
weirdnesses, please mudmail me - Detta. :-) All input appreciated!
You can also email me at detta@@builderacademy.net
East takes you through the other zones I have built here.
Down takes you to the starting room of this zone.

spoilers~
   Ahhh, cheater!!  Don't you want to enjoy the zone?!  *sniff*, ok, if you
really have to look there are a few little neat zone inclusions listed here to
spoil your zone exploring pleasure.  Just type look and then the number to look
at each one (look 1 for example).
1: The Leviathan
2: Spider Cocoons
3: The Dark Candleholder
4: The Metal Contraption
~
E
1~
   This is just a little trigger that sets off in room 1911 when you enter.  A
series of messages goes off and then the leviathan mob emerges.  If you move
more than one room away in the middle of fighting the creature it will disappear
again, reloading fully restored.  This is just the framework so far for a little
quest I'm creating around it.  Ooh, additionally the room that the leviathan
loads in will only let you leave 90% of the time due to slippery mud.
~
E
2~
   The spider's cocoons are used to trap people..  Both players and mobs alike.
If you fight the whisper spider in room 1993 it will start sending messages
about wrapping web around you.  Ultimately if you do not flee or kill the spider
quickly you will find yourself wrapped in a cocoon, unable to move or see
anything.  In this state all you can do is send tells, and wriggle which makes
the cocoon visibly move to everyone else (as immortal you can also use the goto
command).  To open one of these cocoons another player must have a fire torch
(object 1905) and type burn.  This will set it on fire and release the trapped
mob or player.  If a trapped player is not freed within about 5 minutes he/she
will die.

3~
   In room 1982, a dark candleholder can be found.  On zone reset a candle loads
inside, and if this is taken, a passage opens up to the north.  Once on the
other side (room 1983), the passage closes and a voice can be heard telling you
to "leave what you have taken", in reference of course to the candle.  If the
candle is not dropped and you continue on to any other room, it will be purged
and the voice will kindly remind you of your doom, as you are now essentially
trapped.  However, dropping the candle like a good mudder will cause a drow
spirit to reveal herself, explaining that she will open the way if you call on
the name of Eilistraee.  Naturally, saying the word Eilistraee causes the spirit
to vanish and the passage out to reopen..  Albeit for a limited time.
~

4~
   In room 1990 there is a large metal contraption, that essentially produces
potions when the right ingredients are put into it.  PRESS empties the machine
of any ingredients it has, SWITCH mixes whatever ingredients are in it together,
and TURN pours the resulting substance out.  If an empty vial (1949) is placed
into the machine before pouring, you'll get a potion, otherwise the mixture just
pours onto the floor.  There are three books scattered throughout
the zone with the recipes of each potion in, but for now I'll just put them
here.
Red potion (enhances physical strength) -
fang (1900), egg (1908), blood (1951).
Blue potion (enhances magical strength) -
gland (1934), tongue (1950), blood (1951).
Green potion (enhances dexterity & moves) -
weed (1901), hide (1923), blood (1951).
Once the ingredients for one potion are inside, they must be mixed,
an empty vial placed into the contraption and the mixture poured out.
If any combination of ingredients other than those listed are combined,
a black potion will be produced which lowers all three attributes.

Place of Worship~
   A small trail of crushed bones mingles with the broken twigs and branches
carpeting the floor.  A massive stone altar stands within a small clearing here,
enclosed within the trunks of the surrounding trees.  A smoking fire lingers
here, some burned carcass giving off the smell of cooked flesh.  Before the
altar, a large metal grid is embedded into the ground.

[Inside the Cocoon (for Trigger)]~

spider's cocoon (or a good time-out room).  Only the commands who and gossip
should work in this room for any players under level 33.  Oh the command wriggle
also works, but only to make the object cocoon visibly wriggle to anyone in room
