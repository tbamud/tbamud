Outside the West Gate~
   You stand just outside the west gate of Jareth, fabled city of freedom and
equality.  The Western Road runs west from here into farmlands.  To the north is
a deep, tangled forest.

   *Farmlands of Jareth - by Kaan for Dibrova
This zone was made as a connector to other zones, a basic filler zone full
of low level mobs and eq.  DragonSpyre, the Corn Maize, the Sinister Forest,
Jher, and Ofingia all connect off this zone on Dibrova.  It is not a
particularly stand-out zone, but is a decent enough connector zone.
Links: 00n, 15e, 32e, 49n, 95s
Zone 263 is linked to the following zones:
257 Jareth Main City               at 26300 (east ) ---> 25756

Western Fork~
   The road forks here, heading north and south, both directions turning west
again immediately.  It looks as if the northern path heads toward the mountains
and some deep forest, while the southern road heads deep into the farmlands
outside Jareth.  East is the entrance to the city.

Western Road~
   The road runs east and west from here, with farmsteads lying to the west.  
It seems that this road must be a well policed area, judging from the traffic
passing you by, all with almost no regard for their safety, as if the last thing
on their mind would be that they might be waylaid or attacked.  Northeast from
here, you see the gates to Jareth, west the road continues toward a large lake
and the many farms of this area.

almost all of them seem to be of fine, quality stock.  Better watch out, though,
if Farmer Girschwyn finds you here, he may get the wrong idea.  To the east is a
huge field of corn which you may enter into.  Be careful, though, it looks like
it would be pretty easy to get lost in there.

feeling in your gut, one that can only be described as terror, the kind of
terror that only nameless, faceless unknowns can inspire.  Your gut tells you
that ahead lies trouble, pain, and possibly death.  The lake and the farmlands
south of you begin to look very friendly through the trees, now.  This is your

Western Road~
   More and more, evidence of mountain country becomes evident the farther west
you travel.  The road is now more loose stones and pebbles scattered over large
rocks and boulders rather than the hard packed dirt that was the road back in
the farmlands.  You see that the road crosses a natural bridge to the west, both
sides of the road sloping steeply down in forestlands.  There have been no rails
erected so you probably should watch your step.  And watch for loose gravel!

feet below where you now stand.  The way to the west looks precarious, at best,
the east looks much more safe.  Do you REALLY think you need to go west?

   You stand on this sliver of rock jutting up from the forest floor, the road
just wide enough for one cart.  You look to either side and try and suppress the
shiver that threatens to run through your body and knock your balance off
kilter.  Of course, most of the terror you feel is in your head, you have a good
three feet of width, you still feel very uneasy about your current location and
situation.  Amazingly, you see that there is some sort of trail leading down the
north and south sides of the cliff, way down deep into the dark forests below.
You would have to be insane to try and climb down that 'trail'!

   You stand high above the rest of the world, or so it seems, standing here on
this jut of rock that rises up from the forests below.  To the east the rock
walkway heads toward safe, lush ground which heads toward Jareth's farmlands.  
To the west the walkway leads you deeper into a mountainous region, a region
which is, to your knowledge, largely unexplored.

   Just west of you is solid, safe ground, but here, where you now stand, is
definately NOT solid safe ground.  You stand on a tall rock walkway which spans
between two cliff faces roughly five hundred feet apart.  The walkway runs east
toward the far face which seems lush with vegetation and life.  The western
face, which you stand very close to now, seems to be the exact opposite of the
eastern face.  Jumbled rock and scree litter the ground near the walkway's
start, but no trace of greenery can you see anywhere.  Looking down, you see
that the walkway spans over very large and very dark forests, one on either
side.  Caution might be advised when crossing this bridge.

   You stand at the western-most end of a narrow rock walkway which spans the
length of a huge dark forest, miles beneath it's top.  It looks safe enough for
crossing, but caution might be a good idea when attempting to traverse this
precarious bridge.
