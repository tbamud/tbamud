Duluth's Zone Description Room~
   The Location is going to be an old insane asylum with a level range of 6 to
10. The whole zone is about 55 rooms large with three sections, the asylum, the
asylum's cemetery, and the basement. It will have a horror theme so the
alignment will be evil. As for the Plot, the player will have to make his/her
way through the grounds to on a mini quest to find a piece of eq that will
modify their strength up by three but lower their wisdom by three when they wear
it. The quest will have one task that will need to be completed to get the
piece of eq, but there is a quest just to get into the asylum as well. This is
all in a modern day time period.

A Paved Road~
   The road has seen better days. It is doubtful that a car could even drive on
it anymore. To the north the road is blocked by a fallen tree. To the south
the road continues. A vine covered brick wall greets the eye to the east,
effectively hiding what may lay beyond it.

Before a Gate~
   The road is cracked and falling apart here. It continues that way to the
north and south. There is a break in the wall to the east. A heavy iron bar
gate stands there allowing a glimpse of what is behind the wall. Next to it is
an old bronze plaque.

collapse the whole wall. To the south there appears to be headstones, with
someone moving in among them... Or it could just be the swirling fog playing

direction. From here you can go up to the courtyard or continue you along to
the north or east.

A Crumbling Hallway~
   This is just one of the many hallways that make up this maze called a
basement. Old rusted pipes and wires can be seen running above into the dark
ahead of you. Lining the walls are all sorts of equipment. One thing that
catches the eyes is a rack with some straight jackets in it, dirty and tan from
years of use and storage.

A Crumbling Hallway~
   This is just one of the many hallways that make up this maze called a
basement. Old rusted pipes and wires can be seen running above into the dark
ahead of you. Lining the walls are all sorts of equipment. The way west is
blocked by debris and would take much to long to get around it. The south is a
doorway that looks like it use to have door at one point in time.

An Operating Room~
   The first sight of this room assaults the eyes. In the center is a large
table with a light hanging over head. The tile walls and floor are covered in
blood, some of which looks recent. The smell of death is heavy in the air here.
The only way to escape this room is to the north and west.

Insulin Shock Room~
   The most dominate piece of equipment seen is a large bed with restraining
straps. Next to it is a drip apparatus and a stainless steel work try on the
other side of the bed. There is still a needle and syringe on the try. The
visions of people convulsing and having seizures cross your vision for a brief
moment.

Electro-Shock Therapy~
   This area is set up much like the Insulin shock treatment room to the west.
There is a large bed with restraints. An electrical device sits behind it. At
the top of the bed is an object that looks as if it is suppose to fit over the
head of the patient. Funny... The piece of electrical equipment doesn't have
any dust build up on it.

A Hallway in Disarray~
   This hallway looks like a giant hand shook it upside down. There is
equipment and trash littering the ground everywhere making it difficult to walk
through. There is a door to the north. The hallway goes east but the passage
to the west is block with debris.

A Secret Room~
   Unlike the rest of the building this room is in remarkable shape. There is
blood red carpet on the floor and a few disturbing paintings on the walls. In
the center of the room is wooden table. Even though this room is in good shape
there is still an uneasy feeling. Maybe its from the low lighting.

table~
   The table is about waist high and made from a rich mahogany. It has many
dents and ding's in it from years of use. The most interesting thing about it
is its lack of dust.

E
paintings~
   The paintings are of morbid landscapes or of hell it. They are both
beautiful and disturbing. They are framed in thick mahogany.
