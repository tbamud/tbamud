   This is the stage which overlooks the entire auditorium.  The stage is about
three to four feet off the main floor.  Drab brown curtains frame the outside
of the stage, giving it a stage-like appearance.  Huge cords and pulleys swing
overhead, obviously used for special effects for the non magically active.
The floor is made of sturdy wooden planks.  Backstage, you can see several
props and huge objects to fill in the background of the stage.  Looking out
into the auditorium, you can see rows and rows of seats and a milk dispenser in
the back.  The walls are...  Why am I doing this?  Most people don't even read
the descriptions of the rooms unless looking for a door of some sort!  Well
there is no door here.  I bet you have brief mode on, don't you?  So you are
probably missing several of our witty jokes!  Why must we go through all this
painstaking writing of descriptions, if they aren't going to be read?  You
probably aren't even reading this!  [Editorial :)] Well, anyways, the only exit
is to the north.

Dunning Auditorium~
   This large spacious lecture theater would probably seat close to 300 and
reminds you of movie theaters of old (like when they sat more than 10).  Its
main purpose seems to exist and collect dust.  Maybe someone is doing some kind
of study here.  There is a sign on the east wall near the front of the room.
