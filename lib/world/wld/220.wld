@nZone Description Room for the @REnchanted @WKitchen@n~
   @n
@WZone name@n : An Enchanted Kitchen
@WLocation@n  : It should probably be part of an enchanted house.
@WLevel@n     : 10-20
@WRooms@n     : Approximately 24
@WMobs@n      : 9 unique mobs
@WObjects@n   : 4
@WAlignment@n : All mobs will have a good alignment, except for the
            icemonster and Oreo the cat.
@WTheme@n     : Imagine a huge, giant-sized kitchen, in which utensils are
            about as tall as the average man. Its complete with a fridge
            and oven to explore, counters, and even a mouse hole.
@WPlot@n      : Snuffins the mouse is sick of being tormented by his rival,
            Oreo the cat. It's the player's job to help save Snuffins.
            Other than that, there isn't much. It's a big kitchen with
            kitchen-like things. :)

wafting in from the north are highly @Gun@gpl@Gea@gsa@Gnt@y, and everything
around is tremendous in size.  The temperature is agreeable, though
definitely on the @rwarm@y side.  The cavernous room looks to be some

@WBeneath the Big Chair@w~
   @yA gigantic chair with black, @Dsteel legs @ystands here.  It is
pulled away from the table slightly, and you can hardly see over
the @cpale blue @ycushion.  A refrigerator is visible to the east, as
well as an enormous table to the north.  Also, ominous clouds of
dust seem to stir, almost as if they were alive...@n

@WUnderneath the Table@w~
   @yLooking up, the kitchen table forms a ceiling high above.  It
blocks all light, and even with a lantern, the strange shadows
lurking about are scarcely visible.  Whispers seem to come from
all directions, while clouds of dust dance noxiously by.  To the
east, the oven door is left open.  It looks like an easy climb
from here.@n

outside a large hole about as tall as a human man.  A tiny @wg@yl@Yo@Ww@y is
coming from the inside, though it is impossible to make anything out.

@WSnuffins' Dwelling@n~
   @yEverything inside is, refreshingly, average-sized.  A spartan
twin bed covered in thick blankets is pushed to the side, while a
large, cherrywood desk dominates most of the room.  Candles burning
atop it give off an aesthetic vanilla scent and just enough heat to
keep the room at a comfortable temperature.  One of the walls is
decorated with family @Dphotos @yportraying a happy group of mice.  The
presence of numerous @Wbooks@y, @Ymaps @yand @gglobes @yhints at a person who
