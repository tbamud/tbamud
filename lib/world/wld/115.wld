   This seems to be an old abandoned monastery.  It has a very distinct smell
of dust and rotting wood..  The floor is made of marble, and cracked.  The
walls of wood are faded and beginning to rot and fall apart.

   Not much here.  There is not much to be said, it's a forest there are trees
and grass.  But to the north there is a building that looks almost like an old
church.  The grassy lange you travel between the trees is overgrown and
untended.  The remains of some nice flowers and shrubs are barely visible
through the grass.  A large wall can be seen to the north.

runs past you.  He is mortally wounded and bleeding badly, he stumbles to the
ground.  The man looks up at you and says, "Run, Fast, Get Out Of Here !!!  "

bird pirched on the lowest branch observing you with enthusiasm.  There are

system for the entire garden.  There are pipes that run underground from the
stream that lies here.  There are small fish swimming around back and forth in
the stream.  One of the fish get up enough courage to swim up and nibble on
your toe.  There are exits to the north and west.

Path To The East~
   A metal fence runs east and west before a large open field to the north.
It seems to stretch to an old building to the west.  The open field beyond is
littered with objects that are not quite discernable from here.

Entering the Battlegrounds~
   You work your way into a collapsed building.  The roof and walls have all
collapsed, leaving only the frame and part of the southern wall and roof
standing.  What looks like a trampled battlefield can be seen to the north,
east, and west.

The Doom Priest Guild~
   The room is plastered in shadows making everything difficult to see.
Various scrolls, books, and containers are filling bookshelfs on every wall.
Some are even overflowing into piles on the floor.  This looks like a room of
magical studies.
