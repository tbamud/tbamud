The King's Road~
   You stand at the beginning of the actual King's Road.  The road is wide
enough for several horses to ride along side by side with room to spare.
The stones which make up the road have been put into place with such skill
that the road seems to be perfectly smooth and perfectly straight.
   You spot a small trail leading to the south through the undergrowth which
surrounds the road at this point.
A traveller passes by and waves cheerfully at you.

On The King's Road Outside A Castle~
   You are standing on the King's Road.  Before you is a large
Castle, evidently built not so much for strength as for beauty.
It is not totally without defenses, though, for it is surrounded
by a deep moat, and its windows are just narrow slits for archers
to shoot through.  To the north there is a drawbridge across the
moat.

A Guest Room~
   You are standing in a large room.  Although it is comfortable enough,
you can tell it is not meant for any of the most illustrious guests,
since it lacks that extreme luxury found elsewhere in the Castle.

   This small passage is about thirty feet long and is well lit by the
torches on each wall.  The torches have been locked inside small metal
cages to ensure that they are not removed.  The strangest thing about
the torches however, is the manner in which they burn, they have what
appears to be a constant flame in that it does not flicker whatsoever,
and does not give off any smoke.  Perhaps they have been magicked to
burn forever...
   There are three cells along this passage way, one on each side of
the corridor right near the north end and one isolated at the south
end of the corridor with a small metal plaque located over the door
in the keystone of the archway.

bones and corpses lying all over the place.  A lot of the corpses
look too recent to be from the Townsbridge murders of almost a
