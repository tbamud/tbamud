The Green Dragon~
   This lively inn is the Green Dragon, the undisputed leader in the art of
innkeeping.  The air is filled with the sounds of clinking glasses and laughter,
animated conversations and tales of great and seasoned adventurers mix with the
constant murmur of local gossip.  A flickering fire lights the place with a
gentle glow, warming it cozily and providing a center of gathering for the
joyful storytellers.

Shiriff Post of Delving Lane~
   You are in the Shiriff Post which acts as the nucleus for the three shiriffs
of Delving Lane.  As you examine the shiriffs on duty, you come to realize
that the halflings of the Shire are not to be reckoned with.  You cower with
awe.  The only exit is to the west.

A Dark Tunnel~
   This cramped underground tunnel is dark and stifling, the miserable sound of
dripping echoes along the stoney walls, and perhaps the sound of faint
whipsering.  Bone-chillingly cold, this passage seems to actively discourage
travellers from continuing further.

Smuggler's Storage~
   The cavern opens widely here, allowing room for the many storage materials
that lie scattered around.  The place seems to echo with random scuffling and
scurrying sounds, as it would if infested with rats; although the noises are
somewhat too loud.

Smuggler's Storage~
   The jagged walls lean closely in, dark shadows flickering subtly in the thin
beams of light that pierce from the west.  Rivulets of cold water trickle lazily
along the stone, mixing with the dust to create a layer of slippery mud.

A Three-way Intersection~
   In the darkness, three yawning openings can be seen, each looking as damp and
cold as the others, although the sounds of scurrying seem to grow louder to the
north, the path perhaps a little lighter to the west.

End of a Dark Tunnel~
   The cavernous tunnel comes abruptly to an end, this small room cloaked in
almost absolute darkness and musty with dampness and age.  The black floor is
slick with mud and various slimes, sticky cobwebs clinging to every dreary
surface.

A dark tunnel~
   You stand inside a small underground tunnel.  The ceiling is so low that
you must crouch to avoid hitting your head.  The tunnel continues north and
south.  To the west you see a Shirriff Post while to the east lies a small
home.  All you can see is darkness.

A halfling hole~
   You stand inside a rather crudely built halfling hole.  The many passageways
and winding paths remind you of a rodent's lair.  The air is musty and damp

The Tailor's~
   Yards of various types of fabric are spread carefully out for display,
examples of handsewn gowns and garments hanging from the ceiling or modelled by
wooden stick figures.  Baskets of different colored threads and ribbons sit on
a table in the center of the room, allowing the buyer to choose exactly what
they want.
