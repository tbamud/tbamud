Before the Clearing~
   North of you is a clearing in the forest, encircled in tents, while to the
east you see the eastern highway.  The tents are crude, made of thick cloth and
dyed green to blend in the shades.  Occasionally you hear the sound of a dove
or a crow.  Oh yes, and of course the clang of sword against shield.

In the clearing.~
   You are in a clearing in the forest.  Around you are tents made from curde
planks and rough linen.  They have been dyed green so they blend in the
surrounding forest.  North the clearing continues, while to the west and east
are tents.  You can also go south to the eastern highway.

In a tent.~
   You've entered a crude tent, with nothing more in it than 4 bunks, obviously
just a place to sleep for the orcs.  The only exit you see takes you back east
to the outside.

you have just entered the first.  Two bunks are in the corner, and a
weaponsrack stands here - now empty.  You can go further into the tent to the
west, or leave to the east.

combat retreat for the orcs.  They come here to get strength for yet another

In a small tent.~
   You are in a small green tent, made from crude planks with rough linen.  In
this little tent a small orc makes food for the rest of them to eat.  In the

You can leave the tent to the east.

In the clearing.~
   The clearing stretches to the west and north of here is a small tent.
Unlike the rest of the tents, this is not green, more like a shade of purple.
It is well hidden in the shades from the woods.  A small star has been painted
on the tent, just over the entrance.  To your south you see the side of a crude
tent with green linen, and a dagger in relief painted on it, while west a
thicket blocks your way.

The Throne room.~
   You've entered the throne room of the Orc Chief called "the Boss".  In the
middle of this quite big though still crude, green tent is a big chair.  From
this chair the Boss directs the attacks on the caravans along the eastern
highway.  North you see yet another opening to another tent and you may leave
to the east.

In the Shamans Tent~
   You have entered the shamans hut, and a bizarre light is streaming from the
center of the tent.  It's a mixture of blue and the purple from the tent.  You
think this is very pretty, and you'd like to watch it for a long time.
Unfortunately you seem to have come at a bad time for that, since the owner is
here...  In the middle of the tent a fire is burning with a blue flame, and
magic seems to permeate the very fabric of the tent.  You see a bunk in the
corner, and you can leave to the south.

where the great gates of Hannah can be seen in the distance.
