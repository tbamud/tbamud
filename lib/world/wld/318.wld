West Main~
   The road continues downhill to the south, toward wine, women and drunken
brawls.  The stench fish and sea-goers gets stronger and stronger with each step
you take down toward the docks.  To the north is the way into the main business
section of the City.

West Main~
   You are nearing sea level, which is just south and downhill from where you
stand.  The repugnant smell of fish and guts, sailors and sweat is still all
around you, but to your shame you find that you are beginning to get a bit used
to it.  North leads the way uphill into McGintey's business district.

West Main~
   You have come to the southern end of West Main, where the street stops it's
travel downhill and south, allowing the Dock Road to take over, which is just
west from here.  The road heads north, uphill toward the main city section of
McGintey Cove, or east into a tightly packed alley where a sizable crowd of
people seem to be gathered around, watching something.

you reach sea level and what looks to be the grubbiest section of any town you
have ever seen begins.  To the north, the road heads uphill toward the main
business area for the Cove.

the main business area.  South of you is mroe of the road, which runs along side
a very large building, presumably the Boat Station, where one may book passage
to any of the islands of Dibrova.  West of you is an alley where it looks like a
sizable crowd has gathered, all intent and yelling at something in their center.

people who have crowded together to watch and bet on these beasts which battle
on the ground in the center of this man-made ring.  The exits lead east and

here in McGintey Cove.  This Boat Station is said to be the largest commercial
outlet for personal travel overseas in Dibrova.  A great number of people go in
and come out of this place, many obviously foreigners.  The entrance to the Boat
Station is to the west and the road runs north and south.

East Main~
   Still heading north and south, this road has turned from the easily traveled
paving to the north to a muddy, sludgy mess that you must literally make an
effort each time you take a step to lift your foot high enough to clear the mud
that threathens to ruin your footwear and bog you down.  To the east is a very
crude looking building, a sign hanging out front with no writing, just a badly
painted picture of a cracked beer mug on it.  To the west, a narrow, dark alley
allows limited access.

Netweaver~
   This small shop is festooned with nets of assorted size, color and shape.
Most are made for fishing, for those commercial fisherman who supply the town
with fish to eat.  Some, however, are made for a more deadly purpose, one which
a player may find quite useful....

McGintey Boat Station~
   Upon entering into this huge hall, the first thing you notice is the rush of
sound that comes at you from every side.  It seems everyone is trying
desperately to yell over everyone else to make sure they get the right ticket to
the right destination.  The next thing you notice is the amount of people who
seem to have found a home here at the station, on the benches which are rowed
neatly in the center of the floor.  These benches were obviously intended for
use by the customers who await the arrival of their boat, but it seems that some
the lower class, possibly less fortunates have decide that these benches work
very well as a bed, too.  There are ticket booths to the north and south.  The
exit is east.

screaming people.  Everywhere.  Love it here, yep!  (That WAS sarcasm) There are
more ticket booths to the north, the south, and the west.  The exit is off to
the east.  Past more bums.

   Ahhh, finally some light!  Although, with the light that is available here,
you may have been better off not seeing.  There is a small, hooded lantern
casting light on the alley floor where five large punks huddle around a craps
game they were gambling on.  Notice the word 'WERE' there.  See, you have
interrupted their game, and they don't seem pleased.  No, not at all.

The HQ of the Bloody Scythe Gang~
   This place, what appears to be an abandoned warehouse, is home to one of the
deadliest gangs of thugs in McGintey Cove.  All crime, all prostitution, and all
illegal gambling activities are controlled from this room.  Well, that is all
crime, prostitution and gambling that the Dead Boys (McGintey's other gang)
don't control is controlled from here.  Seems that the Bloody Scythes don't take
a shine to having unexpected company, either.  Better duck!

Dock Road~
   Dock Road comes to an intersection on itself just south of you, where it
splits east and west and runs along the docks where all of the many ships are
kept while in port.  To the east is a small dirt trail.  It looks to be fairly
well used, however there is something about it, something slightly unsettling
that makes you think maybe you'd better not head that way.  Don't you have a
ship to catch anyway?

just walk right in.  There is definitely someone home from the sounds you can
from out here, there are probably quite a few someones home.  They are making a
loud-assed racket.  You may head south away from the shack or north into it.

   These boys are, of course, not dead.  In fact, they are far from it.  They
seem to have a non-stop party that goes on and on and on.  Almost makes you want
to join them, but just as you begin to think these party animals might be cool
to hang out with for a few drunken hours, they turn as one and decide that
kicking your ass would be more fun than the beer for a while.  Hey, you know,
You Gotta Fight...  For Your Right...

The Cracked Mug~
   A gaggle of sailors all huddle around an old battered piano, most of them
drunker than drunk can be.  They all sing along in off-keys to an off-key tune
played by a sailor who probably has never touched a piano before in his life.
Seems like a harmless enough place to come in and have a drink or two...

To the west is nicely kept house decorated in pastel colors.  For some reason,
there are a number of women leaning on the front balcony, smiling and waving.
Hm, you must look extra good today or something!

probably be a favorite hangout for sailors and call girls, not the affluent
qworld traveller type like yourself.

housing project in it heyday.  There are doors both north and south of you -
both of them are closed at this time.  Of course, the doors don't look like they
would do much to keep anyone in or out of the rooms beyond.  They are all nasty
and corroded, most of the wood peeling away in strips.  The hallway heads east
into more filth, best to watch your step, there is no light and you could trip
on some garbage.
