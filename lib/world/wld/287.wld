A Narrow Crawlway~
   Ouch!  You can barely squeeze through this passage, which is only a foot and
a half high.  It was also hidden behind a stone block; that is, no doubt, the
reason the goblins have not tried to follow you, being too weak to move it.
You, however, can still shove it aside, should you wish to slither north.  The
wide passage to the south looks much, much more inviting, however.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
   It is very easy to walk here.  A forgotten river has carpeted this cave soft,
sandy clay, and streaked the walls with frozen ripples.  The north wall has a
small crack in it, and to the south this wide tunnel becomes higher, and
slightly narrower.  A shadow on the west wall implies a tunnel mouth, leading
out of your lantern's reach.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
   What a lovely place!  It is not wide here - your shoulders fit, with little
room for company.  You judge the cavern roof to be at least 70 feet above your
head.  Crystal formations in the rippled walls split torchlight into countless
sparks of flame, reflected from the quartz veins which embroider the stone in a
timeless brocade.  The walls are mainly vertical, but taper outwards enough to
support a block of breakdown, hanging like Damocles' sword, fifteen feet up.  I
doubt it will fall, however.  The tunnel is lower but wider to the north.  A
small stream trickles from a tiny hole, high up on the wall, to exit through a
small tunnel to the south.  To the east, a larger cave continues to a bend.
That boulder troubles you.  Anxiously you examine its support, and notice some
writing on the wall.  There is a NEWLY CARVED SIGN here.  Read it!

   The runes are of a well-known mode, but you know not the tongue.  They say
something like this: Tuo sdael lennut nretsae.  Retsasid ot sdael lennut htuos.

A Narrow Ledge~
   The stream plunges downward, to join another, which foams and rages far below
you in a deeply cleft canyon.  You hear nothing above the water's roar.  Like a
cat you tread on a spray-wet ledge only six inches wide.  Not a nice place.
You do not look down as you continue.  A traveler must count courage among his
baggage, no?  Perhaps you will be repaid.  Through the mists to the south you
glimpse a golden gleam.  To go there you must creep cautiously along a ledge too
narrow for a surefooted cat, and slippery as fish skin.  It is not too late to
turn back!  A narrow crevasse leads down the cliff, but only an acrobat could
turn round and descend it.  Your nose brushes an inscription.

   You have found the lost mine!  Chunks of gold ore litter the ground, as large

the mine, and gather the riches therein, you step from the tiny ledge to the
broad flat table of stone near the mine entrance.  That is, you try to step that
way...  Your feet slip.  Oh dear.

A Short Tunnel~
   This tunnel does not go very far.  Soon it bends again to the south.  A
strong draft blows from there.  The walls here are no longer rippled, but
smooth, and covered with writing.  There are many small inscriptions, but you
can only read three: one in orcish, another in common, and a third, written
large by a firm hand, in the secret dwarven tongue.  Looking closer, you see
another, in ogrish.

The Tunnel's Entrance~
   O traveler from Midgard, your journey has not ended, but begun!  You are just
inside a cave entrance.  It stretches far into mountain-darkness.  Just to your
east, an underground stream leaves a lower cave.  If the the same water flows
inside the cave, it must have passed under your feet at a lower level, for it is
in a gorge seventy or more feet deep.  To your south you see the smooth line of
a road cutting the woods.  A sign is carved into the stone here.

years and burned or stolen most of those that were reported to be magical.  One
of the walls has a huge oil portrait hanging where there are no shelves.
Looking about you, you are amazed at the number of books still left, but most
are poorly written works of popular fiction.  Alas!  There are some exceptions;
a map hangs on the wall, for instance.

The Secret Library Vault~
   Wow!  There is enough dust here to grow a crop of corn on the shelves.  But
there may be even more interesting things on the shelves than corn.  Why, on
that shelf just out of reach, you see a book that has to be the Book of Dwarven
Herblore.  Too bad you can't get it; it would be useful to a wizard.  A few torn
off pages litter the lowest shelf, nearer at hand than the great dusty tome.

is a work of great art, and no king wears its equal. Indeed, the stone
quarried from the [dwarven?] mines of Holdraxe is said to have magical
properties.  I know little of these.  But it is said that the right
sort of opal makes the man invisible who wears it in a ring.  Sorcery

papyrus scroll fragment~
   Some ancient scribe has written a list of legendary weapons, of which
only this tiny scrap remains.
The great warrior Highlander, it is said, bore a mighty claymore, the
equal of which is unknown to me.  I have heard it glowed brightly when
drawn, but I see no way this would be useful. The great smith Durgandon
forged it in the dwarven halls; its enchantment is opposed to any evil
and protects its wearer from harm, it is said.  I know not if this is
true. The blade is known to me only in legend; if indeed it ever was,
it is now lost forever.  No word of Highlander has been heard for long.
Zebenak Rykalp of Wazen bears a sword made by the smith Dorig, of the
Foehammer clan.  Its name is Krat, or "Razor" in the Vallonian tongue,
named for its thinness, and its renowned edge.  It is supple steel,
but quite sturdy, and I have seen Zeb plunge it deep into an oak without
injuring the blade. Dorig is truly a great craftsman.

small vellum~
   Like the rest it is a fragment:
The age of Iron came next; it is our present age. In these days men
dwindled both in stature and nobility still further from the Bronze
Age, so say the philosophers. They began forging their tools and
blades of iron, and no longer wrote the great epics of the last Age.
Death still reigned, and reigns, over the world of men, cutting
short their little works. How large they seemed! Yet all is not lost.
So says the philosopher:
              To the world that stumbles lost and lone,
              A king descends from heaven's throne.
              Death by death is overthrown.

   Here is the end of the Great Hall.  Its size awes you.  The King, however, is
not here, and his throne is dusty.  With his people he has taken up arms and
marched forth to fight the evil armies that have lately assailed his kingdom.

carpenter built of scrap on hand, after the goblins forced him to leave
Brocdenborough.  In fact, many of the former citizens of that village now live
here, or in Venango.  The Sheriff has not retired his post; no, he moved here
because from here he now commands a small band of guards who go out hunting
goblins, intending to free the countryside eventually.  A tattered sign and a
newly printed poster hang on the inside wall of this shed.

   And it really IS a mess, too.  Bones of all sorts lie tramped into the sandy
clay floor.  Often they still have quite a lot of meat left on them.  Goblins
are quite apt to bite something and throw it away, though it comes from a king's
board.  Grotesque green-skinned warriors of all sizes and degrees of hideousness
mill about, chewing on meat, whose origins you do not wish to know.  The east
smells like a knacker's yard, when he is boiling down corpses.

his pot, probably not tasty spices.  Dry, boiled bones are piled in the corner.

and it is run by several sturdy trolls turning a horse-mill.  Slag heaps lie all
