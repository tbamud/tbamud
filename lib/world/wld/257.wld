Maris' Armory~
   You stand in Maris' Armory, self proclaimed finest armory in all Jareth.
An ornate but servicable looking counter makes an 'L' shape around a door which
appears to lead into a rear service and holding area.  Shields adorn the walls,
all polished to a bright gleam, and a suit of armor stands attentively on a
pedestal to the right of the counter.  There is a plaque on the front of the
pedestal labelling the suit to be the 'Authentic Armor worn by an Ionion Knight
during the 2nd Crusade'.  A sign on the front of the counter reads; Better to
die on your feet than live on your knees.

   Jareth by Kaan for Dibrova
Jareth was my very first zone, which I stupidly used zone #30 as my vnum
base.  I figured that overwriting would be easier and I could use the
existing info for reference as I was writing offline at the time and was
pretty confused as to how the files were set up.  I was wrong about it
being easier and I don't suggest that route for anyone new to building ;-)
Jareth has all the amenities of a hometown with a couple of added features.
There is the Casino off the Boardwalk - look for the snippet if you need it
on the snippet page - where players can try their luck and see if they can
make some money the old fashioned way.  There is a blood bank near the
Temple where a player can give blood, losing some hp, but gaining some cash.
The cash is minimal and the hp drain is too, but for a newbie, anything helps.
This was to be our main town for all of Dibrova, however with a bit of
whining and a lot of persuasion, we went the route of allowing players to
choose their hometown at the main menu and unfortunately most do not choose
this wondrous metropolis.
Please forgive if any objs or mobs are close to Midgaard's - in my defense
I say that is WAS my first zone, and I was very in the dark on how a mud
worked at all at the time.

Zone 257 is linked to the following zones:
258 Light Forest                   at 25729 (east ) ---> 25803
263 Farmlands                      at 25756 (west ) ---> 26300
 33 Three of Swords                at 25771 (north) --->  3301

North Bourbon St.~
   You are on a wide promenade which stretches north and south for quite some
distance.  This seems to be one of, if not the, main thoroughfare for the city
of Jareth.  Shops line both sides of the street, offering an abundance of
choices for any traveller in need of supplies.  To the south it appears that the
street meets another street of similar size and opens into a large sqare.  To
the east you see a weapons shop and to the west you see an armor shop.  Quite
convenient, wouldn't you say?  Obviously, Maris the arms dealer thinks so, too,
since his name is on both store fronts, proclaiming him the procurer of the
finest armor and weapons in all of Jareth.

community service set up so that wayward adevnturers who get a bit too over-
zealous in their wanderings can be treated properly in Jareth's hospital.
Because it is a non-profit service, the room is not designed for comfort but to
accomplish it's purpose.  A slightly reclined chair sits in the center of the

around you the hustle and bustle of city life carries on, paying no notice to

river bank, to the south Bourbon St.  Offers a slew of inns and taverns, and

holding the cleanest, purest, and sweetest tasting water in Jareth.  This is

Captain Vulcevic's Boat House~
   This leaning, ramshackle, single story wooden structure perched on the edge
of the river is the proud home and shop of Captain Vulcevic, formally an admiral
in Lord Eyeball's Royal Fleet.  Vulcevic retired from duty when a sudden squall
took the not only his ship, but most of his crew to the icy bottoms of the
Polarinus.  There are all manner of nets, buckets of tar, boxes of nails, and
other paraphenalia for the repair of river and sea going vessels.  A cot hangs
in one corner, obviously Vulcevic's bed.  There is no counter or area where one
would expect to get helped, so you must just wait upon the Captain for his
appearance.

Jareth City Bank~
   A true work of art in every sense, this building is obviously the proud work
of an architect who takes great pride in his or her work.  Stone pillars rise
from four equidistant locations in the floor, tapering in the center while being
wide as a full grown Gold Dragon on the tops and bottoms.  The enormously high
cathedral ceiling offers a beautiful stained glass rendition of the Holy Wars
which Lord Krolar led those hundred years ago against the foul Goblin Hordes.
A line of tellers stand behind the main counter, a beautiful cherry oak work of
art intricately carved and inlaid with what looks to be gold.  A large iron door
built into the northernmost door behind the tellers leads to what must be the
vault, although this is only conjecture because at this time the door stands
closed, and it looks as though it would take Dibrova's most skillful lockpick
and the strength of ten giants to open it.  South is the exit to Floris Ave.

   You can now understand why this street, in all it's majesty, was given the
name Bourbon St.  As far to the south as you can see, inns and taverns, brothels
and bars line the street.  You realize that for many, this area of town would be
quite a little slice of heaven, possibly even a large slice!  Your step gets a
bit lighter and for some reason you feel like whistling a merry tune you heard
once in a bar in Shreve.  To your immediate west you see Grainy's, which many
say has the best malt liquor in all of Dibrova, and to your east you see the
Kitty-Kat club.  The sign reads 'Fine Dining and a Great Night's Sleep!  ', but
from the look of the servers you can see through the windows, they serve more
than bar burgers.  To the south are more shops of ill repute, and the town
square opens up to the north.

Reception Area at the Kitty-Kat Club~
   Fine furniture is scattered throughout this room, allowing customers who are
awaiting a table to sprawl in comfort.  At an ornate black desk polished to a
high sheen sits a short, balding man with thick spectacles perched precariously
on the end of his nose.  When not making reservations for his guests, he
constantly varies between shoving his specs back up on his nose and adding up
the hourly sales on a large abacus.  This is obviously the owner of the
establishment, and the man you must speak to if you wish to enjoy a meal and/or
'rest' at his fine establishment.  To the south is an open doorway leading to
the main dining area and a set of stairs lead upwards into what you assume would
be the 'entertainers' quarters.

being that is it paved with well maintained cobblestones, all kept extremely
clean.  The fresh smell of the water so near by, the people passing by who all
seem in good cheer make this part of city far more pleasant than the dismal
dregs found in the southern reaches of the city.  To your west is the wall of a
large complex of flats.  To your east you see the western wall of of the

curtains seperating the 'hostess' booths' tell you that unless you like your
whiskey the old fashioned way and your woman slightly used, this is not your
kind of place.  Most of the patrons of Jahred's look as if they'd rather stick a
knife in your back than let you buy them a drink, so a friendly game of cards is
probably out of the question.

turn tail and run from this shop.  You try and hold your breath, but that
requires you to first take a deep breath, so that doesn't work.  Instead, you
decide to give in and inhale all the sights and sounds and soon you get so used

room is 315 then the second must be 316.  The second room is known as the
storeroom.  All that is required in the storeroom is to load one of each mob you
wish to be a pet.  This room can not have any exits and will never be used by
mortals.  Although a pet shopkeeper is not required it is recommended.  After
all of this is done ask your coder to implement the petshop.  It will not work
until the code is changed and the MUD is rebooted.  The cost of pets is 300
times their level.

here, which seems odd to you, because only the occasional murmur or low voice is
what drifts over to you, and the more of those customers that notice your
entrance into the Goat, the quieter it gets.  Soon it is completely silent.
Everyone is looking at you.  "What'll it be?  ", the bartender growls at you

to have farther north.  More trash litters the walk ways and the people seem to
be more of the rough-and-tumble sort.  You see that farther to the south, the
road takes a turn to the west, just before what looks to be a ...  Quilt shop?
To your north the road continues toward the town square and other inns and bars.
To your east you can peer through windows into the dining area of The Kitty-Kat
club, and what you see is very enticing.  To your west is The Bloated Goat, a

impossible size of this 'hall'.  The ceiling, which must be there somewhere, is
far too far up for you to even catch a hint of it.  The floor is not a floor at
all anymore, but the dirt and loam of a forest.  You give a small start as you
realize that there is a man standing directly before you.  How could you have
missed him when you first walked in?  There is a large tree to your east which
looks to be hollow, and the exit into the reception room is north.

   You stand at the entrance (or exit) to the great City of Jareth, the pride of
all Dibrova, at least the pride of all cities in the Known Lands.  Jareth, also
known by some as the City of Freedom, was built on the auspice of racial and
class equality.  All races are welcome here, no one is refused service in any
establishment, or so it is said, and all forms of worship are respected.  To
leave the city, you need only to move east, but to enter it may prove to be a
bit more difficult.  Although Jareth does boast the title 'The Free City', it
does have laws and they are enforced.

South Bourbon St.~
   Aaahh...  And what a grand street it is!  Bars and taverns abound on this
grubby thoroughfare, giving it the perpetual look of double-visioned dimness
that can only accompany inebreation.  It's as if the street has taken on the
persona of the businesses which occupy it.  North of you are a plethora of bars
(surprise), to your east is (three guesses) a tavern, to your west there seems
to be an alley curving out of sight, slightly southward.  It's hard to see
anything in the alley, mainly because of the curve it takes, but also because it
seems to be very dark.  To the south is Granny's Quilt Shop, a shop that,
although in a rough part of town, has nevertheless perservered and even been
able to thrive on a healthy chunk of business, or so it seems from the way the
building is maintained.

   The first thing you notice when enter the main room is that the whole place
is clean beyond reason.  The soft glow from the crystal lights (suspended in
mid-air) give the high polished brass which adorns almost every spot for a rail
an almost blinding gleam.  Every server, without exception, is a strikingly
beautiful young woman wearing skirts which leave little to the imagination and
tight blouses which leave even less.  As your hostess shows you to your table,
hands you your menu, and asks if you would like any drinks, you realize that if
there is any other place in Jareth you would like to be more than where you are
now, it really doesn't matter.

Grainy's Bar & Grille~
   You enter the room and immediately a wash a pure noise (more accurately
described as racket) slams into you full force.  The clientele here seems to be
the rowdy sort, but no fights seem in the making, just a lot of good old
fashioned comraderie.  There are three or four tables with card games in play,
one with a group of happy drunks singing along with the bard who is plucking out
all the wrong chords to a popular bar tune in the realm.  A long bar to your
left offers a wood stool to rest on and a cold drink to quench your thirst and
you have the choice of half a dozen empty tables as well.

the shop a bit of a mystical appeal.  Pastels, mirrors, flashing lights all
dazzle your eyes in an attempt to create a magical atmosphere.  This must be in
hopes that the crazy colors will build a desire in you to buy, buy, buy.

buildings which stretch out for some distance.  To the north runs River St,
which crosses over the Alquandon River and continues to the more affluent and
entertaining side of town.  To the south lies more of River St and what looks to
be a number of shops, while to the east, Floris Ave offers a variety of shops
which gradually give way to Jareth's city proper.

exchange weapons for better killing power, and stretch out in anticipation of a
good fight.  You can't help but feel just a bit apprehensive as the group begins

   Things probably couldn't get much worse.  You are in the deepest, darkest,
smelliest, and probably most dangerous part of Jareth.  Even the constables
don't dare come here.  Blood stains coat every wall, some blackened and peeling,
some still wet and running.  The only exit out of here is to the west.  Well,
more aptly put, the only WOULD BE exit out of here is to the west, but
unfortunately a dozen of the meanest looking street toughs you've ever seen are
blocking the way.  They mill about, unconcerned, knowing that their sheer
numbers will prevent you from any advantages.  Your only chance to run like hell
is now, and although a cowardly way to deal with the situation, it is
recommended.

adds to your lust for material wealth as you survey your surroundings.  All
around you, the finest of all furniture and goods lay sattered haphazardly
around, as if the owner of these items were not aware of their value.  In one
corner, a chest heaped with coins lays on it's side, while in another, a rack of
glowing, golden armor and weapons sits propped against the wall.  Your only

Dalston the Wanderer began way back when he was still a strapping young man.

City of Freedom', was built on the auspice of racial and class equality.  All
races are welcome here, no one is refused service in any establishment, or so it
is said, and all forms of worship are respected.  To leave the city, you need
only head west.  Entering, however, may prove to be a bit more difficult.
Although Jareth does boast the title Free City, it does have laws and they are
enforced.

Jareth is protected so well by these fine men and women of the City
Constabulary, you feel much more at ease about walking the streets of Jareth.
Whether that is because you feel you are better protected or you can better get

pieces which would allow comfort and rest without marring them in any way.  You
give a start as you realize that many of the seats in this room are already
taken by people who blend so well into the seats as almost seem invisible.
Many seem to be in meditation, while others simply relax, enjoying herbal drinks
offered by others of the same kind.  The entrance to the main Ranger Guild Hall
lies south through an archway which shimmers with a light not unlike that of a
warm spring day.  North is the exit to Floris Ave.

   This is main HQ for all the constables in the city.  Seeing such a gathering

you've probably done nothing to invoke their anger.  Besides, if you had done
something to invoke their anger, you would have been 'escorted' here and
unceremoniously dumped in the holding cell to your east.  You see a few of the
rag-bags of Jareth sleeping off their hangovers there now.  To the north is a
closed door.  Mounted on the door is a plaque which labels the room beyond to be
the Magistrate's Office.  From the way voices are kept to a low murmur in this
room, you figure the Magistrate must be a tough cookie, at least on his workers.

whether thoroughbread or jackass they receive the best of oats, a nightly sponge

Grigor's.  Grigor, being a fisherman by trade for most of his younger years,
knows all the best spots on the river and all the best tackle to use.  You may

Warrior's Lounge~
   This room was specifically made by warriors for warriors.  After a long, hard
day, a warrior needs a chance to take a load off.  Round bar tables sit
haphardly around the room with plush chairs circling each.  Scantily-clad ladies
serve drinks ranging from high protein to high octane moonshine, depending on
what your personal needs might be.  A practice area, wide open to those seated
at the tables, allows not a place for warriors to hone their abilities to a
fine, cutting edge, but it also gives those seated some entertainment watching
their peers make asses of themselves while practicing new moves not quite
perfected.

would be your guildmaster seated on it.  Flanked by guards on either side, both
carrying spears the size of a large tree, you can't help but feel just a bit
intimidated.

Temple of All and None~
   Robed and hooded priests walk solemnly by with heads bowed.  After being so
used to the normal din of the city, the near-library silence that surrounds you
hear seems almost like a dream.  The temple, formed in the shape of a cross,
allows worship at three of the four points of the cross, each devoted to an
alignment, a following of belief.  The fourth point is the entrance to the
temple itself, which is north.  A door in the wall near the temple exit allows
access to the Cleric's Guild.

Meditation and Prayer~
   Solemn and intense, this room offers the chance for clerics to find a bit of
inner peace before embarking upon adventures into the outside world.  A row of
kneeling pads line the floor along the north and south walls, allowing comfort
while in prayer.  A flight of stairs lead up to the Temple of All and None, and
to the west, the High Priest of Jareth.

River St Bridge~
   This bridge, one of the wonders of the Known Lands, spans the Alquandon River
in such a graceful arc it seems the craftsmanship required for such a feat would
be impossible.  Near the crest of the arc, engraved into the steel an
inscription reads 'This bridge dedicated to the great and wonderful people who
made the notion of a free city a reality.  ' It is not signed, but such metal
work could only be the work of the fabled dwarven metalsmiths at Krat.  North of
you the boardwalk begins, south is a square and most of Jareth, and you may
enter the Alquandon River from a path leading down.

Constable's Outpost~
   Here the law of Jareth maintains a small but servicable outpost for their
main office in the center of the city.  Posters of known criminals hang on the
walls with a short description of each criminal at the bottom of each.  Knowing
Jareth is so well protected by the fine men and women of the City Constabulary,
you feel much more at ease about walking the streets of Jareth.  Whether that is
because you feel that you are better protected, or simply more able to get away
with whatever it is you would like, well, that remains to be seen.

   Not quite what you would expect from a casino.  More like a mafia cooling
room.  Lights dimmed to near-darkness, smoke in a cloud hanging low over the
entire room, small tables with four chairs and a dealer at each are scattered
about the room.  Men in dark armor stand with their arms crossed at 3 foot
intervals along the walls watching and making sure no one cheats.  The exit is
south, or you may sit down and try and win some fast cash.

Salazar's on the River~
   This bar seems to have such a festive atmosphere, it nearly reaches out and
snatches you onto the dance floor.  Women of every race strut their stuff, men
cut a rug with reckless abandon, and the music, so loud as to alomost deafen
you, moves through your body and makes you want to join in.  Low boothes line
walls east and west, a long bar next to the bandstand offers drinks to your
north, and the dance floor, smack dab in the center of the room, simply calls to
you.
