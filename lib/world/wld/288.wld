Doctor's Zone Description Room~
   Galaxy by Doctor of EnvyMUD.
To use this zone, make sure that SOMEWHERE in the zone, near the begining, the
authors name is visible to the players, a sign or edesc in a room will be fine.

Include the area and the author (perhaps the EnvyMUD name also) in your
help file for areas.  And even a small mention in your credits file would
be nice.
I myself need no mention, as the work I did was very minimal, and quite
truthfully, selfish in nature *8). Many thanks to the EnvyMUD people for
allowing this to be shared.

I do not think that the cleric spec they are talking about is a friendly
healing others one, so you will need to work that one out yourself (maybe
the mage one will do in a pinch)

Changelog:
   Entry has been changed to a trig.  To change it back, remove the two items in
 28801 and add a door down to 28802.  Remember to replace the credit info.
   Removed entrance from 28803 to 28802.
   Added nomob to 28825.  Some muds have people who often go in there to kill
all mobs with an areaspell but in a small mud where nobody goes in, all the
mobs on that floor will end up there, sooner or later.
   All season doors were locked both sides on the original but Ghost Shaidan
seems to have only locked one side and I left it that way.
   Added near-deathtrap prog (almost dead) to 28830.  Original was a deathtrap,
port was a non-deathtrap.
   Added trigger functions to cover the spec_cast functions mentioned in room
28800.  These were partly written by me, mostly by Fizban.  If the damages I
used seem a bit light, just adjust them.  Saves have not been written in.
   Added nomob to various rooms, to keep mobs in their sections.
   Fixed various typos, grammatical errors, changed some room descs to fit the
changes.

Inside a Tavern~
   You are inside a dimly-lit room.  The atmosphere makes you feel
uncomfortable.  In front of you stands a mysterious gypsy.  She whispers, 'Your
fate and destiny lie beyond this world.'  You are still wondering what she means
when you suddenly notice the crystal ball ...  It glows fiercely and displays
the Universe!

Inside the Crystal Ball~
   You have touched the crystal ball and find that you have gone inside it: a
world of stars and wonders!  As you look around, you figure out there is no
choice but to go forward.

Inside the Galaxy~
   You are now inside the galaxy.  Stars and nebulae smile at your presence, and
comets and meteors wander around you.  You realize that this world may not be
the true galaxy after all but just another fantasy zone.  Exits lie in most
directions.

Along the path of the Dipper~
   You can see bright stars shining all around you but nothing of special
interest.

End of the Dipper~
   You have finished the path of the Dipper.  Here, the most prominent feature
is a set of claw-marks.  You also notice a room to the south; it looks as if
Polaris could lie here.

The Polar Star~
   You have entered the private chamber of Polaris.  This is a room of great
significance.  You can see a powerful telescope pointing down towards the
Universe (SNOOPING!  ).  It is from here that Polaris commands the Universe.
You feel you have come to end of your search in this galaxy ...
