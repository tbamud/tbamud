   This is a stone quay set upon the west shore of the Pool of Innocents.  The
quay backs up against a solid stone wall on the west, south and north sides,
hemming it in so that the only direction to travel is out onto - or into - the
Pool.  Near the northern edge of the quay there is a strange purplish substance
floating upon the water of the Pool, almost like a lillypad but more thick and
almost spongey.  It criss-crosses across the Pool's surface, leading east toward
another smaller quay on the east side of the pool.

Treading the Pool of the Innocents~
   You more splash than tread any sort of comfortable poise within this thick,
murky water.  The docks lie to the west, it should be easy enough to hoist
yourself up onto them from here.  The spongey padway which crosses the surface
of the pool is right next to you, however it proves impossible to get a firm
grip on the squishy sunstance of the pad to haul yourself up onto it.  Did
something just brush your leg under the water?

On a Sponge Pad~
   Your feet sink into the purple substance, getting slightly wet from water
seeping over the edges and yet still it holds your weight.  The padway leads
east and west - blackish, smelly water surrounds you.

Treading the Pool of the Innocents~
   You splash around in the murky goo of the Pool of Innocents, unable to get a
firm grip on the spongey substance of the padway which floats on the surface
right near you.  Trying to swim in any direction on the surface of the water
only gets you tired - looks like you will have to take a deep breath and make a
dive for it underwater.  The Nether Docks lie to the west.

Supplication~
   Those who seek retribution or forgiveness for the deeds they have done in the
afterlife come here in supplication to the Nether Lord and his Matrons.  This
flat pad of stone holds hoardes of prostrate beings, all begging of the Matron
for a chance to receive the blessing of the Lord so that they might gain the
Eternal Rest.  Do not seek to cut in on those closest to the Dias of the
Matrons, you could end up one of these, begging for Eternal Rest.

The Dias of the Matrons~
   The Matrons are the self-appointed protectors of the Nether Lord.  They all
lay claim to having given birth to the Lord and since none of these hideous
ladies' claims have ever been disproven they all stand watch against unwarranted
intrusions.  Some even say that it is possible that every one of these five
ladies contributed to bringing the Nether Lord into being - that the Lord is
somehow the spawn of all five of these things.  The Lord's Throne lies dead
center at the far east side of the Dias.

The Throne of the Nether Lord~
   The throne of the Nether Lord gleams a bright, glowing white, shimmering in
all its brilliance with the knowledge of all and none upon its seat.  It sits
slightly higher than the rest of the dias, backed into a niche in the stone of
the cavern that surrounds the Dias, the Pool of Innocents and the Docks.  It is
truly the seat of power - power which must be conquered if ever you wish to
leave this place.

The Way~
   Your journeys have finally come to an end within the Nether.  Whether your
achievements were those of fable or those of folly, only you can answer - but
one thing is certain: To have entered into the Nether and returned alive is a
feat that only few can lay claim to - and of those few, only a handful speak the
truth.  Be well, adventurer - may you flourish in the Realm of the Living.

swim immediately, the water's dark color obscuring sight almost alarmingly.

   The thick black water of the Pool slides along your body, the feel of it an
oozing, mucusish sensation.  It is impossible to see any further than where you
swim immediately, the water's dark color obscuring sight almost alarmingly.

Narrow Crevasse in the Pool of the Innocents~
   You can sense more than see that you are now in an enclosed crevasse in the

vaguely disgusting.
