On a Forest Slope~
   Not much here.  The forest slopes downward into am even darker region of
forest which at this point is not in sight.  To the east is a more level section
of forest where you at least have a better fighting chance.

   *Banshide - by Kaan for Dibrova
This zone was written using a smattering of information found on various
websites regarding the mysterious Banshee and their traditional home, Banshide.
We implemented a new attack type for the mobs in this zone called EMBRACE since 
a banshee's way of killing their victim is to embrace them and drain their life.
There is some kick ass eq in there that shouldn't be easy to get and a Fountain
of Eternal Life that we made to contain a neverending supply of healing water - 
water that cast cure light with every drink.  By making the village so difficult
to find, we felt it would keep this fountain from being abused.
Entrance/Exit: 00E, 28N

On a Forest Slope~
   The forest slopes gently downhill toward an unknown destination, if there
even is one at the bottom of this hill.  You realize that although you haven't
been in the forest that long, you are hopelessly lost.

In a Quiet Forest~
   All around you the forest leans in and forces you to be aware of it's size
and strength - it's immensity.  Not a bird calls, not a creature skitters, just
the wind, creaking through the dark branches overhead.

Downhill in a Forest~
   The hill now towers high above you, while still continuing for a very long
distance down as well.  All around you, the darkness prohibits any kind of sight
distance.  Makes it kind of spooky.

In a Quiet Section of the Forest~
   The quiet of this part of the forest gives you the creeps.  At least in the
level part of the forest you could hear the occassional skitter of a squirrel,
the squak of a buzzard, even the cry of a Demon Dog was better than this
complete silence.

At the Base of a Huge Tree~
   The tree you stand next to is so large, so immense that you could not even
wrap your arms halfway around it's trunk.  It soars high into the darkness of
the forest roof and beyond, still as thick as four men at that point.  You hold
your light a little closer to the tree and see that it has some sort of markings
on it.  Off to the west, you can see some sort of glow.

On Some Tangled Roots~
   You stand atop a large tangle of roots which extend out from a gigantic tree,
one which looks to be the oldest in this forest, if size is any indicator.  You
look down into the vines.  It almost looks as if something is moving down there.
In fact, it appears that something is glowing to the south.

Across a Log~
   This log traverses a deep ditch, one that looks like would prevent you from
further travel in any direction.  Down in the ditch, you see something small and
shiny, although from here you cannot see exactly what the item is.  Is that some
sort of glow to the east?

Through the Tree Roots~
   You are now deep in the roots of the giant tree.  All around you, thick roots
dig into the soil of the forest feeding out it's life.  Shining your light
ahead, you think you may see furtive movement behind one of the vines.  You may
even see some kind of light off to the north.

Near a Fox's Den~
   You stand near a small hole dug into the hillside.  It appears that there is
no one home right now, or if there is anyone home, they are being very quiet and
very still.  Looking around you, you realize that you may be just a little lost.
Make that a lot lost.

lives in accordance with nature.

On a Large Boulder~
   You come to a rest atop a huge boulder which rises up from the forest floor.
It reminds you that just west of you is the cliff face which leads up to where
the sun is still shining, where you do not have to fear for your life every step
of the way.  It is easy to forget there are still places like that - at least
while you are down here.

if you could get up on the boulder, you might get a good view of the way
downhill.  The only other option is to just continue down hill and hope for the
best.

seems to have been scuffed or pulled off in some spots.  What kind of animal
could climb vines that high and that thin?

bridge across a large ditch.

   You step through the trees and out of the darkness into an open glade nestled
deep in this hollow.  A small lane stretches south into a tiny village, lined by
low, stone and mortar homes.  The source of the glow you saw from back in the
forest is a small street lantern mounted on a post.  Although it's light would
be considered meager at best out in the world above, here it seems to burn with
a fierce light, one that makes you squint.  You see that all along the lane
there are similiar lanterns on posts as well.

The Temple Blvd~
   This short street leads directly west to a temple where a beautiful, hypnotic
melody can be heard, softly soothing your tired muscles and relaxing your guard.
To the northwest there is another large building of some sort, it almost looks
to be a temple itself.  Voce Lane, the main street through the village, is just
east of you.

The Temple Blvd~
   You stand before the large doors to the temple.  The song from within seems
so calming, so loving, that you almost tear the doors open without a thought.  
But then you think - why in the world would anyone come through a terrible and
evil forest, almost get killed, search their way into this village through the
hollow, and then start singing?  Maybe it would be best not to open those doors,
after all.

The Home of the Father~
   This place, more a mausoleum than a home of any kind, house a large open room
which holds a huge four posted bed, which dominates most of the space the room
offers.  Thin, white sheets enclose the bed and it's occupants, however the
sheets are so thin that you can see that they are lying perfectly still, hands
clasped over their breast, eyes open and staring into space.  The exit lies
south.

Temple of the Voce~
   This large, open room is one huge set of stands with progressly get higher
and higher until they touch the far wall.  A great many banshee, many of
differing disciplines, come together here to sing for the Father, the Mother,
and the Goddess Cathari, who sits on her throne here, enjoying the music.  
Although most of the banshee here seem to notice your presence, none of them
seem at all threathened or even bothered by your presence in their temple.  
Some even smile kindly at you.  What the Hell is going on here?
