The Entrance to France~
   This large street of France is flooded with candlelight from surrounding
high lamps, the flickering glow adding an air of romance to the atmosphere. A
large sign reminds visitors to be sure to visit the cathedral of Paris here.
The street continues on to the east, the Champs Elysees lies to the north, and
off to the south the town of Lyon can be seen.

The Beginning of Notre Dame Street~
   This beautiful street has been decorated with blossoming flowers and
branching trees that grow on either side. Delicate flower petals drift lazily
in the air, partially obscuring the more distant views of this continuing east
to west path.

Notre Dame Street~
   This flower-strewn paved street continues on to either the east or the
west. At the side an immense stone wall can be seen, a massive steeple rising
from above it. No ordinary structure, it is beautifully designed and carefully
decorated, obviously belonging to a very important cathedral of Paris.

The Entrance to the Cathedral~
   Here lies the entrance to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the large door
beautifully ornamented and decorated with representations of the four
evangelists.  Above the door is a breathtakingly huge rose window, alight with
flickering candlefire from the streets below.  The street continues on to the
east and the west, the southern way leading into the cathedral.

around except for the large steeple visible to the east. Everything is still

The Atrium of the Cathedral~
   Awe-inspiringly beautiful, this massive gothic cathedral has obviously
spared no expense. The high ceiling has been gilded and patterned with gold,
imposing stone walls home to various carved statues, and the grand marble floor
polished so that it shimmers with the surrounding candleglow. Two columns of
doric design stand like guardians either side of the entranceway to the north.

embedded along the bejewelled ceiling. Dazzlingly white, the smooth floor is

grave concrete walls bleak and unyielding. Even the warm wooden hues of the
many benches have been dulled with time and dust.

   This long tunnel is dark and smells horrendous enough to make anyone lose
their breakfast. Damp and cold, the menacing shadows look like the perfect
place for ambushers. Little rodents run here and there, beady eyes glistening
in the dark, the ground wet and mushy with goodness knows what.

A Dead End~
   The tunnel comes to a black and filthy end, subtle murmurings from the
shadows giving the impression that thieves and criminals are plotting an
imminent attack. The smell too, is overpowering, stagnating in this airless
part of the tunnel and decaying into an even fouler stench.

The Entrance to Champs Elysees~
   Ahead lies the entrance to Champs Elysees, a large lush forest of the city
of Paris. The tranquil singing of birds permeates the air, and the peaceful
hush of the air passing through the leafy branches. The trees are so tall that
their tops can hardly be seen, gigantic trunks planted in the ground like the
columns of a grand hall. To the north lies a golden gate, a prominent notice
fixed to the bars.

Fluttering of wings breaks the silence every now and again, pigeons landing to
gobble dropped seeds before hurrying away.

its once smooth surface worn with the scratchings of birds, one or two nests
visible in the higher nooks and crannies.

prominent sign displays the notice 'Closed for remodelling, sorry for the

stone ground, creepings of moss beginning to grow like dark green veins along
the paving. To the west stands a large building, apparently a large
headquarters or school.

place although there are no candles or torches to be seen. To the north and
south, swirling magical portals can be seen, probably leading to some strange
place, though where cannot be guessed.

Royal Hall~
   Massive and beautifully adorned this royal hall is where the king of France
can usually be found. Gold ornaments and many bejewelled sculptures decorate
the place, fine marble flooring polished and gleaming. Bright streams of light
illuminate the place, cast from elegant candelabrums of gold suspended from the
ceiling.
