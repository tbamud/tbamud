The Beginning Of The Southern Desert~
   This path marks the beginning of the long road to the southern
part of the world.  There are several rumors as to where it leads,
but no one knows for sure.  Looking south, you gaze into a panorama
of a rocky, cactus-dotted land, shimmering in the heat of the day.

The Beginning Of The Southern Desert~
   Scrub brush and cacti of many sorts are beginning to
appear, you are thankful that they do not grow on the path.
To the south, you see a desert, teeming with desert life.

The Southern Desert~
   Heat waves make the world shimmer, as you trod through
what feels like an oven. Plants of all sorts cling to the dry
ground here, barely surviving the dry heat. The only
sound is the low whisper of hot wind, and the small
rustling of rodents fleeing from your presence.

one part leading off to the east where it disappears into the
sagebrush. To the south the path continues, getting
more and more overgrown as it goes.  Near to the south
the northern edge of the large mesa looms up, a black wall

of the Taco Bell.  (or is it Taco Hell?  ) Stumbling through the weeds, you
suddenly realize that this is all some deadly trick of the desert.  The mirage
quivers, and disappears before your bloodshot eyes.  The path here leads east

A Small Clearing~
   You have arrived at what seems to be the uttermost southern
point of the Earth.  to the east there is what seems to you to be a
large Indian-style dwelling of some sort, made of a dark quartz-like
stone.
About half way up it you can see the outlines of a sealed door.
   Looking about, you wonder why you begin to
hear noises...

A Small Cave~
   As your eyes begin to adjust, you can make out scattered bits
of bone and broken pottery strewn across the floor. To one corner
you see the remains of what looks like a campfire. Feeling
claustrophobic, you suddenly feel the urge to leave!

Inside A Small Stone Dwelling~
   It is very dark in here, and you shiver despite the heat
of the desert outside.  A circle of stones lies in the dust,
looking magical in placement. the walls around you are covered
with paintings of what could be identified as scenes from the
beginning of the world.
