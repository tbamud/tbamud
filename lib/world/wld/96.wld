The mad wizard's hut~
   The inside of the hut is deathly quiet, save for the breathing of the wizard
and the bubbling of the cauldron.  Shelves along the walls are lined with vials
and glasses, holding a variety of colored liquids.  Inside the cauldron is a
purple-red liquid, bubbling and splashing all over the floor.  The only exit is
back east, out of the hut.

On the Path into the forest~
   The path into Domiae is surprisingly well-lit, despite the image given at
the threshold.  Dried leaves crackle underfoot, and the forest animals scurry a
safe distance away before turning to regard this new invader.  Birds chirp
their merry songs, voices intertangling into a mesh of sounds that faintly
resembles a choir.  The path branches off to the west, but the main path
continues north.

Path to a distant hut~
   The sounds of the forest grow strangely faint as the path gets closer to the
hut.  The trees grow more crooked, and the leafs underfoot grow more plentiful
and dry.  Most of the small animals are gone, and only the biggest predatory
animals of the forest dare come this close to the hut.  The front of the hut is
decorated with strange runes, and animal skulls hang from the eaves.  The
doorknob is fashioned from a human thigh bone.  Exits are back to the main
path, or into the hut.

A Cleared Path~
   The limbs and scrub brush have been hacked off and thrown to each side of
this new path.  Very little traffic has passed this way, only a few plants and
grass blades peeking up through the forest floor are trodden.

A path through Domiae~
   The path goes on into deeper foliage, and it now sprouts grass and other
greenery.  The dirt becomes slightly softer, and roots protude from the soil.
The refreshing scent of life is in the air, and the birds sing it's praise.
The forest animals seem to take no heed of anyone, travelling along the path as
any human would.  Squirrels, rabbits, hares, foxes, and other animals can be
seen scurrying about.  The path continues north and south.

A four-way intersection~
   A small hole in the treetops forms a sunlit glade.  The animals of the forest
are far more active here, and the ground is littered with evidence on their
passing.  A bird chirps gleefully from a hole in a nearby tree, soon followed
by a chorus of her chicks.  The path here splits in four directions.

A dead end~
   The birds chirping intensifies greatly.  A massive tree has fallen over the
path, blocking any further advance.  Many birds are nested in the falling tree,
which accountrs for the increase in noise.  The tree itself is covered in moss
and lichen, with violets and wildflowers shooting from the rotted wood.  The
only exit is back to the intersection.

A path deeper into the forest~
   As the path into the forest gets deeper, the sounds get louder and more
plentiful.  The squirrels tittering, the birds chirping, and the animals just
generally scampering about.  The path is filled with less leaves, now, and the
ground gets even softer.  Exits are to the east and west.

   The ground is completely devoid of leaves now, and the soil gets even
softer.  The air is beginning to take on an unpleasant odor, but it's not quite
placeable.  The birdsong is as loud as ever, but the other animals seem to be
strangely quiet.  The path turns south, or back west.

A path into Domiae~
   Flowers line the path into Domiae.  Here, deeper in the great forest,
different types of trees are flourishing.  Rowan, elm, pine, and cedar trees
add themselves to the already plentiful oak.  The ever-present birdsong
intertwines itself with the sounds of the animals going about their business.
The moisture trapped by the trees coupled with the coolness of the air gives
the forest a wet sheen.  The path continues north and south.

   The path takes a turn here, the hard-packed dirt loping in a wide turn.  In
many places the path is interrupted by small collapses, due to ants tunneling
under.  In the underbrush nearby, an animal has burrowed a rather deep hole to
make it's home.  Exits are west or back to the south.

A three-way intersection~
   Birds chirp merrily as the path splits into two trails.  Rabbits and other
'larger' animals seem to use the west path, while squirrels and birds - the
'smaller' animals - seem to keep to the east path.  The northern path, on the
other hand, doesn't look like any animal uses it.  The path continues west and
north, and back east.

The Entrance of the Forest Domiae~
   The entrance to the forest Domiae is forboding at first glance.  Tall oak
trees block out most of the light, and the trail through the forest is
cluttered with leafs and sticks.  However, looking again there are many things
of beauty about it.  Small animals scurry about, and birdsong can be heard even
at the threshold of the forest.  Flowers line the path north into the forest,
which is the only visible exit.

Another turn in the path~
   The path turns back west, and the birdsong grows fainter.  Someone, or
something, has ripped off the lower boughs to the trees.  That either means
someone wants an unobstructed view or someone's property line is near.  Far in
the distance a cave makes a gray splotch on the horizon.  Exits are west or
back north.

momentarily, replaced by a sickening squelch.  The path returns west, or

A holding chamber.~
   A steel barred window lets in light to the spartan room.  A bed and a
chamberpot are all that are here.  The floor is of the same cracked marble, and
the cold stone walls don't show the same cracking and falling that the other
walls do.  The only exit is the way you came.

A hallway entrance~
   The floor here is lined with satin, although torn and bitten from rats.  No
rats are here presently, but signs of their presence are visible.  Intricate
carvings and tapestries adorn the walls, along with a bust of the King in the
corner.  Exits are west or back down.

The royal hallway~
   Along the hallway there is no noise whatsoever.  The walls are still
crumbling, plants are still growing out of the ceiling, of which most of is
laying on the floor.  The floor seems a little less eaten up.  The entrance to
the King's bedroom lies east, or one may return west.

In front of the King's bedroom~
   The front of the king's bedroom is in a perfect state of preservation.  The
door itself is made of marble, set on a cunningly made device that opens the
door at the King's will.  The door is outlined in silver, and two statues in
front of the door are made of solid gold.  Exits to the south, east, and west.

The King's Bedroom~
   Quite the magnificent room, even for a King.  The bed takes up a full
quarter of the room, and the walls are completely covered with carvings,
depicting a mighty battle.  The ceiling is painted in the image of an angel and
her followers, and the furniture is exquisite.  A desk made from the finest
cedar is resting against the wall, with a matching chair.  Both are heavily
cushioned with satin, and carved in strange and beautiful pictures.  The only
exit is north.

A Cleared Path~
   The freshly cut path is clearer to the east while to the west it looks like
someone gave up on hacking through this dense woods.  The trees and brush are
typical of any hardwood forest.
