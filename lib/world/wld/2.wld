The Northern Road~
   This seems to be the middle of a very mysterious looking road.  Everything to
the east appears to be dark and gloomy, giving off the impression that maybe
travelers would better avoid coming here.  However, things in the west change
dramatically.  The shouts of soldiers in training can be heard.  The road
continues to the north and south.

Thieves Avenue~
   This avenue passes between the inner city wall and the warehouse.  The
warehouse is made from sturdy timber with a set of wide double doors that appear
to open outwards.  Wagon tracks lead right up to the warehouse.  This must be
where traders come to unload their supplies.

hidden somewhere within this building.  Of course only a fool would try to

unloading, and sorting through all the supply crates live in this single room.
Mattresses that are shredded to pieces by rats and mice line one wall.  A small
washbasin, stool and bench are the only other luxuries these overworked brutes
own.

The Western Intersection~
   This road leads west to the gate or east to the Temple of Sanctus.  The
Temple is where people go to pray to the gods, they are guaranteed safety
within certain rooms of the temple.  A safe haven is very rare in the realm
these days.  That is why Sanctus was created.

Under the Inner Wall~
   This path passes through the western inner wall gate.  It is extremely dark
in here.  The inner wall appears to be about twenty feet in thickness.  No one
could ever batter down this wall.  Looking up, one can see a portculis built
into the wall.  Its probably best not to wonder what would happen if it were to
suddenly let go and come crashing down.

The Western Road~
   This is the beginning of the Western Road that leads from the Temple of
Sanctus to the western gate and beyond the protection of the dome.  Few people
travel beyond the dome because they fear the gateways between worlds may open
at anytime.  Only brave adventurers dare travel far beyond the city walls.

contact with the gods or each other.  The board is monitored and any questions
should be promptly answered.  If the board is not the right place for a
particular problem to be solved, it is possible to go to the post office and
mail a god.

tales, but many hold truths beyond what even the storytellers realize.

been unbelievable.  Must be the rumors that it was created by the gods are
true.  Several benches can be seen to the north.  The sound of running water can
be heard to the west.  To the south people can be seen, busy in prayer, while to
the east a small room lies, full of several people gossiping.
