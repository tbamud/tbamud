Behind the Waterfall~
   The water cascades down just south of here, pouring into the reservoir used
by the farmers of the Ofingian farmlands.  A long, narrow tunnel heads straight
west toward a very bright source of light, one which is blinding to look upon
without shading one's eyes.

Through the Mountain~
   The weight of an entire mountain enfolds all about you, the immensity and
sheer presence of such a sizable force as a mountain forces itself into your
awareness.  The way west leads toward the bright light, an opening into another
section of the world, cut off from the rest of the world by the impassable
mountain which you currently travel through.  Just east of here is the falling
water of the waterfall which runs down into the reservoir in the Ofingian
farmlands.

Halfway Through the Mountain~
   Squinting against the light coming from the western opening in this tunnel,
you begin to finally get used to the dimness of the cavern combined with the
glare from the light coming from the other opening.  Scorch-marks riddle the
walls of the tunnel, a thick, black, phospherous soot glazes the walls,
dwindling away to the east but getting quite thick closer toward the western
exit.  Some sort of fire was blasted into this tunnel - and more than once.

Just East of the Western Exit~
   The light blasting in from the opening just west of here is now not only
bright, but warm as well - almost painfully so.  Shielding your eyes from the
bright rays does not help to give you any more of a clear picture of what might
lie beyond the exit of that blinding hole, it is much too bright.  The way to
the east is dim, yet for some reason exudes much less of a dangerous vibe than
the way west.

The Northern Exit~
   There is absolutely no way to describe the feeling of coming to the opening
of a cave to find yourself standing well over five hundred feet up from any sort
of solid ground.  The cave 'entrance' is nothing more than a hole in a cliff
face - a cliff which rises far above the green grasslands which it borders the
east side of, very far.  Unless you can fly, the only way you might have the
chance at getting down below into those grasslands is if you hitch a ride on a
passing dragon - and that is just not likely to happen.  Looking directly down
from where you perch, you see a small (or is it small, it could just appear that
way from this height) fortress nestled quite close up to the cliff face.

High Along the Dragon's Teeth - In Midair~
   A very large and very foreboding cave entrance lies to the south, the
blackened rock which borders the entrance testament to what lives within.  This
is the highest point that can be reached along the cliff face, the only way to
go from here is horizontal or down.

High Along the Dragon's Teeth - In Midair~
   The entrance to a cave lies to the east.  It is most certainly very solid
ground upon which to tread, better than the hazardous way of travel which you
currently employ, but the fact that the rock entryway into the cave is scorched
and melted and strewn about with rotted dragonscales is a definite turn-off.

   This is close to the highest point that this cliff face spans, the plains
below a very well-organized place of sectioned farming areas and forests, the
castles and keeps which dot the land mere specks.  Far away to the west is the
glistening water of an ocean or sea, one which is as blue and clear as the sky
above.

to this awful place.  A foul, foul stench billows forth in gusts from the
interior to this cave, the walls and floor of the rock itself layered in a
thick, oozing black goo.

An Outcrop of Rock~
   A way up from here leads to what looks to be the perch and home of what could
only be a dragon.  Sooty refuse spills from the opening of a cave just above
you, a solid stain of black runing down the rock , dwindling into the cliff face
below, soaking into the rock.

An Entrance Into an Enormous Cavern~
   This is by far the largest and most intimidating cave along the Dragon's
Teeth.  That is not to say that the rest of the caves which dot the cliffside
are not fairly imposing and fearsome, but they most certainly pale in comparison
to the amazing size of this cave.  The entrance is at least fifty feet in height
and twice as wide, if not more.  A steady sound from within leads you to believe
that someone is probably home.

   A dark cave leads away into the recesses of the mountain, one that is more
than probably the home to a creature that is best left to itself.  A very warm
and humid waft of air comes from the cave, a thick, breathy surge of air which
does nothing to make the place seem any more welcoming.

Along the Dragon's Teeth, Flying in Midair~
   The rock of the mountain is solid and unyielding, allowing for you to travel
along its face but offering no spots upon which to rest or get your bearings.
Just north of here is the entrance into an opening in the rock, but it does not
look like the sort of place that you might be able to rest a spell.

   The cliff face itself is far too sheer, too smooth to afford any sort of
handholds or foot wedges.  Flying through the air, moving yourself with not only
your will but your hands as you pull yourself along the cliff wall, you chance
to look down and realize that its probably a good idea if the fly spell you make

current altitude, the castles and keeps of the land still but small dots, their
features undescernable.  It is a steady climb down the cliff, one that would
probably not take long .

The Entry Into a Smaller Cave~
   The cave before you is by no means small, however it is smaller in size by
far than the rest of the caves which dot this cliffside.  The entryway is
blackened and scorched from DragonFire and extremely cluttered with old scales
and sloughed skin.  The bones of old meals lie strewn about the entrance,
looking as they were attempted to be pushed out to fall onto the plains below,
but the effort was only half-attempted.

Flying the Teeth~
   The cliff's base lies still far below, a considerable drop for even a winged
creature.  The cliff is of the smoothest rock, as if carefully carved and sanded
by an expert sculptor.  The entryways into the caves which dot this cliff face
are easily found, from any vantage point.  Just north of here is the entrance
into one of the caves.

entrances dotting the cliffside at irregular intervals, nearly every one of them
marked by a blackening of the rock around their openings, a scorched, dirty

Flying Just Above the Ground on the Cliff Face~
   There is only one area that looks any good at all to 'land' on the ground
below, and it lies to the south a short distance.  Everything other place below
is strewn with waste from the dragons which reside above, their old scales and
the bones from meals long past lie in heaps upon the ground, not to mention a
sickly black oozing substance - almost like tar - which coats much of the refuse
and the ground.

less than friendly.  Of course, it could be that the people below who the entry
into their land might be the unfriendly ones.  Only one way to find out...

although the light which permeates this place is a red-hued, onholy light which
flickers and twists almost as if alive, like that of fire.  The passage runs
deeper into the mountain or ends just west of here in open air.

   The walls of this emormous room glow in amber hues, a reflecting light that
makes concentration fairly difficult.  Most of the floor of the room is clear of
any sort of debris, as the dragon which makes his home here needs a large amount
of space to stretch out and relax when he is slumbering.  All along the edge of
the floor lies strewn bits and pieces of old meals, bones, treasure and other
various objects.

feet, making your footing treacherous to say the least.  Darkness and death lay

   The denizen of this large cave has to be the most distusting form of life
that this world could house.  The black goo which was only on the floor at the
entryway now covers the walls and ceiling, as if spattered and splashed by
something very large - and the smell, the smell is indescribable.

the floor but covering everything in a thick, three to four inch pool of the
stuff.

floor, mired down by a thick, black, gooey substance which coats the entire
cavern.  Heaps of junk, treasure, and bones lie scattered and jumbled, covered
in the goo all about the room.

plains below.  Cold air blows from the depths of the cave, a frigid, odd air
that smacks of the unnatural.

   This can only be the lair of a white dragon, a very feared predator who's
anger and evil is matched only by a very select few of its cousins.  Frost coats
the walls, iced over in many places to a thick, white sheen.  Stalagtites are
replaced by sharp spikes of ice which have dripped to form gigantic icicles.

anger and evil is matched only by a very select few of its cousins.  Frost coats
the walls, iced over in many places to a thick, white sheen.  Stalagtites are
replaced by sharp spikes of ice which have dripped to form gigantic icicles.

Entrance to a Glowing Cave~
   An odd glow comes from the inside of the cave, a strange light that seems
both steady and fragile, as it flickering but not really flickering.  The walls
of the entrance are blackened and scorched, but only at this front area.  Just a
bit further in, the walls of the cave are smooth and clean.

A Glowing Cave~
   A huge, gleaming cave lies only a few steps from here, its walls covered in
glowing, clear shards of crystal which are melted into the walls, embedded by
the strong heat.  The exit to this place lies just to the west.

Lair of the Crystal Dragon~
   The glow from the walls makes your vision swim a bit before coming into
focus, the glimmer and gleam of so much clear crystal reflecting light from one
wall to another.  The place is a wonder - the dragon which resides here must
have spent many years collecting the shards to make this place completely
enclosed in the glimmering glow of so much crystal.

Entrance to the Emerald Cave~
   A green glow comes from the innards of the cave before you, a powerful
emanation of strength and wealth.  All but the green glow is completely dark,
the glow making the entire scene before you seem surreal, otherwordly.

In an Emerald Cave~
   A huge chamber lies just to the east, the source of the green glow which
could be seen from outside the cave.  All manner of treasure, mostly precious
gems, lie scattered about in heaps all over the floor of the room.  This is
obviously the home of a dragon - best to be extremely cautious.

The Emerald Lair~
   This is the home of a great Emerald Dragon, one of very few still exist
anywhere in the world.  The walls are aglow with a greenish light which comes
mostly from the many emeralds which are embedded in the rock, melted and
scorched there by the dragon's killing breath.

A Smaller Cave Entrance~
   Smaller.  Smaller meaning only twenty feet high and thirty feet wide.  Do not
be fooled.  The creature which resides within is no easy kill.  The scorch marks
which riddle the walls of the cave all the way through give testament to the
fact the caution would be well advised.

A Scorched Cave~
   The blast marks from the fires that seem to be a common theme with all of
these caves on the Dragon's Teeth seem to be much more pronounced in this cave,
the scorchings running all the way back into the large room which is just to the
east of here.

Fire-Blasted Cavern~
   From all appearances, this huge room has been the site of many ferocious
battles.  The walls are scorched and covered in blackish soot, the floors a
riddle of claws gouges and blood-stains.
