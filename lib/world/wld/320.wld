Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.

At the Shoreline~
   The calm sooth mind and body, lending a feeling of peace and comfort to any
traveler who passes.  The waves roll gently by, the ocean seeming harmless and
worry-free.  A rock littered shore lies to the north, so jumbled and covered in
rock as to be unpassable.

   The water is a gently rolling calm here that seems to go on forever.  The sky
and the water match almost exactly, so blue the water and so clear the sky.  A
rock littered shore lies to the north, so jumbled and covered in rock as to be
unpassable.

   The water has grown tumultous and rough here, the waves not high but
frequent.  Water splashes into the air as the small waves spalsh into each
other.  A rock littered shore lies to the north, so jumbled and covered in rock
as to be unpassable.

At the Shoreline~
   The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn a bit,
the water bobbing and jumping rapidly.  Every now and again a small fish can be
seen jumping up from the wake, searching for food on the surface.  A rock
littered shore lies to the north, so jumbled and covered in rock as to be
unpassable.

At the Shoreline~
   The sea has turned to calm that is almost unsettling.  Any sailor would bow
their head and say a quick prayer to the Sea God at this time to pray for a wind
of some sort.  Looking in all directions, the sea is still and quiet.  A rocky
shore is to the north, its boulder riddled area too cluttered to be passed
along.  A long jetty lies to the east running south into the ocean, a tall
lighthouse at its end.

   A good, steady wind blows from the east, making sea travel swift and easy in
this area.  The sea's currents move with the direction of the winds, at least on
the surface and help to lend direction to the traveler.

enough, in fact, that they do not warrant an attempt at climbing.  It seems that
another way to the lighthouse will have to be found.

Among the Tradewinds~
   The constant wind that blows out of the east pushes the sea along at a steady
pace, along with all that is upon it.  The tang and swill of the sea assails
from the wind blowing so constant, giving the day a fresh, new feeling.

Wild, Foaming Crests~
   The water rises and falls with such force that it seems the world must be
shaking on its foundations.  The water splashes and crashes against itself, foam
and froth all over the surface of the sea.

Wild, Foaming Crests~
   Waves crash and slam against each other in a constant swirl of motion, spray
and foam spitting high into the air.  The sky has darkened, looking just a bit
stormy.

   A dense fog has rolled in, making it hard to see for any distance.
Everything seems to have gotten very quiet, making it almost surreal in this
area.

In the Fog~
   A thick fog has rolled in over the ocean's surface, obscuring what lies ahead
and making it almost impossible to see more than a few feet ahead.  Things seems
to have gotten just a little too quiet.

A Drizzling Rain~
   The rain comes down in steady sheets of tiny raindrops.  It does not appear
that there will be any thunder or lightning any time soon, just a steady dismal
downpour.

gentle swells at this point.

   A blinding storm has erupted across the seas, causing the water to jump from
casual swells to the fifteen foot walls which are now completely surrounding
this area.  Rain lashes down, stinging the sea with its driving force.
