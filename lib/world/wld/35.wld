The Plains~
   You are standing on the plains.  This is a vast desolate place where
the wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way.  However
you are not the first to wander here.  Before you somebody has left a small
path.  The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead
to anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind
to enter the hills far away north.  A narrow trail scars its way off to the
east as it leads up towards a hillside.

sides by tall, stately trees which lend the scene with a sense of quiet
serenity.

The Laneway~
   The trees stand close here, and the tall, bushy undergrowth prevents you
from seeing far in any direction save east, where a broad lane continues off
into the distance; and west, where the same lane continues towards what looks
like a fairly large city.  The muted sounds of city commotion reach your ears
from a distance; stray dogs barking, children crying, and street salesmen
shouting.
   A steep path leads down from here to the northeast towards the Dwarven
Village, and a small trail leads through the trees towards the hills to the
north.

this land.  The road leads east into the peace and quiet - and dangers -
of the forest; and to the west it becomes the main street of the town;
surrounded by a confusion of shops, bars, and market places.
