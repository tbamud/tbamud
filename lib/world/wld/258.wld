A Well Travelled Road~
   This road still continues east to west, still an extremely wide road, made
for heavy traffic.  To the east, the forest begins to close in on either side of
the road, getting more and more thick the farther east you go.  A smaller road
branches off to your north here, looking as if it is not a very popular road,
probably made by some farmer or woodcutter who wanted easier access to his home.
West you can see the walled city of Jareth, with majestic Lord's Keep sitting
high atop the tallest hill, flying Jareth's standard proudly.

   *Light Forest
   Light Forest by Kaan for Dibrova
This was originally the Miden'Nir, re-mapped and remobbed as a basic
connector zone.  It is now fit to connect to 8 separate zones, more if
desired, with low level mobs to populate it.  It would be my suggestion
that, if you used this zone, take the mobs and junk them and make new
ones.  The ones in this zone suck pretty bad - it has been on my list to
redo them, but I have never actually gotten around to it - always have
an excuse to do something else ;-) Enjoy!

Replace XXXX with a town name of your choosing.

the Innkeeper, but as of late, he only serves the few adventurers that manage to
survive a trip through the forest.

Along the Cliff~
   Heading east, the trail tops a large rise, continuing it's way toward
whatever lies in that direction.  To the west, the trail heads it way along, not
really seeming to head anywhere.

Atop the Hill~
   Wonder of wonders!  You feel as if you could see the whole world from where
you currently stand.  Just east of you, sitting proudly on a large rock, almost
a plateau, is the huge seaport town of McGintey Cove.  The twin bridges which
lead from the edge of the cliff to the city gate are the only entrance or exit
from the town.  The trail also runs west far into the distance, skirting the
southern edge of a huge field, which seems to go on forever.

West of Town~
   The road runs east toward the huge seaport atop the plateau and west, topping
a tall hill.

A Dark and Gloomy Trail~
   The forest around you is so thick now that there is not enough light to see
by.  The birds you heard singing before are now quiet, all you can hear now is
the sound of your own heavy breathing.

A Dark and Gloomy Trail~
   Impenetrable is the only word you could use to describe the darkness
surrounding you.  Trees brush against you on either side, feeling almost like
they tug at your clothing.  The trail seems to continue north, although it seems
much more sensible to go south.

A Dead End Trail~
   The path comes to an abrupt end here, as the trees close around you and make
any further exploration impossible.  It does seem strange, though, that a trail
through the woods would end so abruptly.

Entrance to the Maze~
   You stand at the entrance to a hedge maze with walls twenty feet high.
These walls run north and south from where you stand farther than you can see in
either direction.
