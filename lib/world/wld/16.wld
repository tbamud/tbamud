A Wide Dirt Path~
   This path is several yards in width and the dirt is packed solid.  Hundreds
of people must have marched along this trail.  It almost looks like an army was
marched through here.  A lake shrouded in fog is to the west and the city wall
is to the east.

   Another tower rises above the battlements to the south.  This one is
positioned over the main gate.  More guards and lookouts are keeping watch
above you.  They must be awaiting an attack, but who or what could make it

motions you over and you obey, but not of your own will.  He hands you a note
and tells you to read it which you do without any questions.

if they knew the truth they would all leave him and Camelot would be
defenseless.  The threat comes from a time portal to the northwest where the
dead have returned and seek to gain possession of Camelot.  Very few know the
truth.....  The note suddenly dissolves in your hands.

A Wide Dirt Path~
   You start to see bits and pieces of discarded equipment.  A couple of empty
supply wagons sit by the side of the trail.  This army must have been moving
fast to leave all this stuff behind.  The tracks look to be only a couple of
hours old.  The city wall and the lake still force you north or south.

lookouts.  They are standing a vigilant watch looking outwards, as if expecting
an army to try to swim across the lake to attack the castle.  Everyone in this
castle seems crazy.
