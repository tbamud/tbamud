A Wide Dirt Path~
   This path is trampled, hundreds of people must have marched along this
trail.  The dirt is packed solid and is several yards in width.  It almost
looks like an army was marched through here.  A lake shrouded in fog is to 
the west and the city wall is to the east

if they knew the truth they would all leave him and Camelot would be
defenceless.  The threat comes from a time portal to the northwest where the
dead have returned and seek to gain possesion of camelot.  Very few know the
truth.....  The note suddenly dissolves in your hands.

North Tower~
   Guards stare across the lake, ignoring you.  You try to figure out what 
they are staring at, but all you see are open fields and a decrepit stone 
tower.  Nothing threatening.  You try to strike up a conversation with the 
guards, but they ignore you.

Open Field~
   Only a few peasants and farmers are working the fields here.  They all 
stop occasionally and look to the north in fear as if they expect the devil
himself to suddenly appear.  The fields are neglected and it seems they are 
just now starting to prepare it for planting.

   You start to see bits and pieces of discarded equipment, a couple of 
empty supply wagons sit on the side of the trail.  This army must have been
moving fast to leave all this stuff behind.  The tracks look to be only a 
couple hours old.  The city wall and the lake still forces you north or 
south.
