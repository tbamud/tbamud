Inside A Giant Anthill~
   You have fallen into a large open area beneath the surface of the earth.
Ants can be seen running in every direction.  They do not take the time to
notice anything going on around them.  There are exits in just about every
direction possible.  There is a distinct smell of fresh air here, maybe it's
possible to get out.

Inside The Anthill~
   This small room is packed with junk that the ants have pulled in that has no
use.  There is a little bit of everything in this room.  And the ants just keep
bringing more stuff in.

A Small Room~
   Here is a small empty room that has nothing at all inside of it.  Except for
the few ants that wander in.  Another passage can be seen to the east of here.
The ants have dug through the dark brown soil recently.  The smell of the fresh
earth is invigorating.

A Hole In The Wall~
   Here is a small opening that looks as if the ants were going to make another
passage but never completed it.  A ledge of rock in the southern wall explains
why they stopped.  The ledge has a strange golden sparkle to it.

   Here is another basic room full of ants just standing around looking for
something to do.  Small dugouts in the wall can be seen that looks like they
have tried to make more passages but never completed them.

Farther Into The Hole~
   Now farther into the hole it seems to be a little cooler than it was.  More
passages lead elsewhere in ever direction, and ants can be seen coming from
each one.  Trails of food lead from each room to another where the ants have
been carrying it.

A Passage In The Hole~
   This is a fairly large room that seems to be used often for tired ants to
set and rest awhile without being in the way of others.  The wall has little
indents where the ants lean agaist it so they don't take up as much room on the
ground.

A Tunnel~
   Yet another room where the ants are seen coming and going as always.  Some
are laying around and others look as if they are actually doing work.  The
earthen tunnel lead both east and west.

A Sandy Dead End~
   The tunnel walls consist of a light brown sand, making it impossible to
continue excavation in this direction.  The ants seemed to have given up on
this tunnel once they ran into the unsupportive soil.

A Collapsed Tunnel~
   The tunnel comes to an abrupt end to the east.  It appears that the eastern
wall may have recently caved in, closing off what once used to be another
tunnel.  Strange how the ants have not fixed it yet.

Deeper In The Anthole~
   Now deeper in the hole it is even colder and darker than when you were only
one level up.  More and more ants can be seen running around back and forth
doing there jobs.  Tunnels and passages can be seend in all the cardinal
directions.

A Small Passage~
   This small passage leads west into another part of the anthole.  Sounds can
be heard coming from it.  It almost sounds as if the ants are fighting.
Probably more of the fire ants have invaded the tunnel.

A Caved in Tunnel~
   The tunnel has collapsed here, leaving a sloping pile of dirt that rises to
the ceiling of the tunnel.  In the rubble you notice a large red soldier ant
crushed from the collapse.  Maybe these collapses were planned.

A Storage Room~
   This large empty room looks like it is used for storage.  Shelf-like burrows
are carved into the dirt walls.  Perhaps to place crumbs and other food
particals that they picked up and brought in.

A Caved-in Tunnel~
   A collapse of the tunnel has buried even more red fire ants.  The green ants
that run the anthill must have caused these collapses to prevent the fire ants
from taking over their hill.  The two species of ants must have put up home too
close to each other.

At The Bottom~
   You have now reached the bottom of the anthole.  The fall was so far that
there is no way you could get back up to the other levels of the hole.  Larger
worker ants and guards can be seen roaming in and out of the passages.  The
queen has to be somewhere around here.

   This section of the tunnel is heavily guarded by soldier ants, something
valuable must be contained at its end.  The tunnel here is bordered by rock and
ledge, making more digging almost impossible.

newborn.  The tunnel exits to the north.

forth bringing food and other supplies deep into the anthill for safety.  This
rooms sole purpose seems to be for storage and the worker ants to live.

heard in almost every direction.  The tunnel floor is packed hard from the
heavy traffic.  The tunnel continues east and west.

A Dark Tunnel~
   The thick black soil causes this tunnel to look darker than normal.  The
interconnecting tunnels make it hard to stay orientated in which direction you
are travelling.  East and west you see even more tunnels with side passages.

junction in all four cardinal directions.  It is amazing how a bug with a tiny
brain can build things so perfectly.

thought of being under a lake or other large body of water is rather
disturbing.  To the north you see a reflection off from something.

A Collapsing Tunnel~
   The earthen floor gives slightly as you tread upon it.  The ceiling above
you crumbles slightly and hangs over you, ready to drop at any minute.  The
tunnel turns to the west where it looks like the slightest pressure on the
floor could cause a collapse.

The End Of The Tunnel~
   You are at the east end of a tunnel inside the giant anthill.  You can
faintly hear the sound of ants working somewhere deeper inside.  Looking closer
at the base of the tunnel you get the impression that this tunnel is used quite
frequently.  You feel a draft coming from a small hole in the ceiling, bringing
with it the distinct smell of fresh air, maybe there is a way out.

Buried Alive~
   The dirt and earth sucks you in like quicksand.  A nice little trap for the

they are still far away.  The large tunnel seems to make a turn to the south.

this area.  The ants here do not seem to be rushing as much.  The tunnel
continues north and south.  It is too dark and too long of a distance to see
where they lead.

down smoothly.  A few light brown rocks just out of the floor, ceiling, and
walls.

Before A Giant Anthill~
   You have came upon what has to be the largest anthill ever.  It stands
atleast 20feet high and about 50feet wide.  It is evident that ants have been
entering and leaving this hill for quite some time.  The hole is large enough
for the heaviest armor adventurer.
