Foyer~
   You stand at the entrance to a large home, a home almost large enough to be
called a castle.  To the west a hallway runs into the interior of the castle.
North of you is a door which looks to house a coat closet.

Connector Zone(s): The Light Forest
This was a zone I had to sort of build off the cuff. It was when we
started getting a larger influx of new players and needed this part-
icular level range of eq. I slapped it together in less than a day
and had it ready for play immediately. All things considered, its not
a bad zone for what it was created for.

Closet~
   Upon entering the closet, you immediately notice that it is much larger than
you first thought it to be.  In fact, it is immense.  You cannot see the walls
in any direction, nor the ceiling.

Hallway~
   You have entered a room that, although from your first look from in the foyer
looked to be a hallway, turns out to be a large room which has exits in all
directions.  A hallway runs east from here, there are open doorways to the north
and south, and west there is a closed door.  There is even a large, grand
staircase leading to a higher level, not to mention a set of stairs leading
downward into the basement.

Kitchen~

stocked a whole town could eat here for a month and never have to get any more
food.  It seems strange that only one cook would be on staff for such a large
facility.

size of three men side by side rise from the forest floor, towering high above

the middle of an opulent bedroom.  It's a darn good thing you landed on the bed
and not on the floor, or it might've hurt!  The only bad thing about this
experience is that the man and woman who were in the bed seem to be just a bit
perturbed that landed on them, too.

short ways.  At the western end of the hallway there is a door and on the north
and south sides there are doors spaced evenly apart three in each row.  >From
some unknown source, a soft but bright light keeps this place lit up, and from
the same source, soft orchestra music plays quietly.  The walls here are white
as any you've ever seen, with not a mark or mar upon them.

As a matter of fact, it does house a full grown dragon.

unread.  Seems strange that a famous illiusionist would have these sorts of
things on his office...
