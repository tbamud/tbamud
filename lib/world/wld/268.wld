Blindingly lit hallway~
   This east-west hallway is so brightly lit that you can barely see anything.
You have to shield your eyes just to see in front of you.  It appears to be
made from the same metal as the entrance to the building does.

You see nothing there. Really. You don't. I promise.

credits~
   Vice Island is an evil-only area. It's rather large for a medium-sized MUD
and is intended to be used in concurrence with Oceania.
This area is intended to be part 1 of 4 subareas I have in mind for Oceania.
It has mainly evil mobs, and almost all of the equipment in it is evil only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I make no legal claim on Vice Island save this: You MUST give me credit for
its design SOMEPLACE in your mud. You can hide it if you want, but I want
some credit somewhere for it. :) I spent 6 months making Oceania and Vice
Island, and I feel some need to have it known that my work is appreciated.

Deadly Iron Maiden~
   As you step into the room, you trip over a piece of wire--the wire breaks,
and the bars of the coffin-like structure start to close.  You try to run out,
but before you can, the door snaps shut.  You feel the spikes pierce your skin
as you are about to lose consciousness the closing walls stop and you wonder at
the luck you seem to have of late.

Blindingly lit hallway~
   This east-west hallway is so brightly lit that you can barely see anything.
You have to shield your eyes just to see in front of you.  It appears to be
made from the same metal as the entrance to the building does.  Openings to
your north and south look like they need to be examined closely before you even
think about going those ways.  The Grand Temple of Terror is to your east.

It looks as if this is the true source of all the light. It, however, is NOT
cold like the globe in the first room, and it is also not at all the kind of
place a person could survive if they took the chance.

You can see what looks to be an iron maiden in the southern room--however,
it fits every part of that room...and looks like it's just about to snap
shut. It looks like you'd be very dumb to attempt entrance.

The HellFire Room~
   You should really be more careful in your adventures.  The gods favor you
this day.  This used to be a death trap.  Next time read the descriptions.
The Gods are not always forgiving.

Umm...you're dead. You can't look that way. Leave us alone. We're a DT damnit!

Grand Temple of Terror~
   This shrine to terror couldn't be more aptly named.  Elaborately made
drawings all around the room depict one terrifying act after another.  The
light is so bright that even though you close your eyes to hide the awful
sights, you can still see them!  You want to run, but are mesmerized by the
utter horror of this place.

You see, strangely enough, a way to the High Priest of Terror's office.
