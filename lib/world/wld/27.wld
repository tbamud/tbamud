Detta's [Memlin Caverns] Description Room~
   @BTheme:@n This zone is the under-mountain homeland of a group of neutral
peace-loving creatures called memlins.  Their humble network of caverns has
been infiltrated by a sorceress who has recently risen to power and is seeking
to build her palace beneath the mountain with the help of the enslaved memlin
race.  The basic objective then is to destroy the sorceress, though she has her
ways of staying alive!  For players interested in a deeper knowledge of the
zone, there is @Ynow a little tour guide available@n in the temple who will
explain all sorts of things about the storyline behind it
   @GPlayers:@n This zone is geared towards players
between levels 17-25, and is slightly evil aligned with most of the mobs being
either neutral or evil.  It is primarily a quest zone with killing the
sorceress not being just your usual hack n slash job ;-) Lots of xp to be
gained however if you feel like slaughtering the helpless community instead of
helping them!
   @RLocation:@n The zone itself is almost entirely underground,
and made up of a network of caverns.  Its sole exit however, opens out into a
forest and this is the area it would be most seamlessly attached to.
   @MSecrets:@n There are quite a few here now.  I'd recommend exploring
the zone without taking a peek at these little spoilers..  But if you
must, just type LOOK SPOILERS to reveal all.
   @CNote:@n If you have any suggestions, spot any typos, bugs, or weirdnesses,
please mudmail me - Detta. :-) All input appreciated!
You can also email me at detta@@builderacademy.net
East takes you through the other zones I have built here.
Down takes you to the starting room of this zone.

   The orb is only kept in one place, held by the skeletal creature in room
2763.  The only problem is that the way in is a one way exit, the only other
ways out are a death trap to the east..  Or to kneel to the creature so that he
teleports you out.  In order to get the orb you must kill the creature, which
then leaves you trapped there...  Or does it?  ;-) There is a memlin child in
room 2722 who will explain to you the wonders of Dynar magic - namely that a
glowing circle works as a portal.  So, all you need to do is kill the creature,
take the orb and KNEEL CIRCLE to get out.

   The Sorceress does two main things while fighting.  First, she will randomly
cause a circle of fire to flare up, that will damage you if you try to flee or
exit the room.  Second, she will occasionally use her staff to fireball anyone
attacking her.  If you kill her in the normal way, her staff will remain behind
and reincarnate her after a few minutes.  The only way to permanently get rid of
her, and get ahold of her items, is to get the glowing orb from the skeletal
creature in room 2763.  Once you have the orb, you must defeat the sorceress in
the normal way and then USE ORB as soon as she is gone and only her staff
remains.  This will dissolve the remaining fire elemental and kill the sorceress
permanently.  It will also leave behind everything she was wearing.  By the way,
her fiery dress will burn whoever wears it, unless they are also wearing the
crystal nymph ring.

   Upon entering room 2742, a little girl will appear and transform herself
into a doll (2723).  This doll when kept in your inventory will perform attacks
randomly when you fight.  It will do this three times and then change back into
a girl who runs away.  (The doll will only load once in this room until you
either use up its three attacks, or pass room 2702)

   The Goethite shackle (2708) when worn, cannot be removed except for in the

   In room 2767 you will find a dying memlin who will ask you to hasten his
death.  If you kill him, you can find a diary in his corpse (creature quest),
and he will also ask you to find his daughter with his dying breath, mentioning
"Sandy..  Tunn...  ".  This is a reference to room 2706 (Sandy Tunnel) where a
set of footprints can be seen in the description.  If you follow those
footprints to Room 2712 you can type exa footprints and see that they lead into
a hidden door east.  You'll find a lost child beyond that door (room 2719) who
will ask you to help her find her room.  Beckoning the child makes her follow
you, and patting her makes her stop (the child will run back to the cupboard if
the room is not found within a few minutes).  Upon patting the child in room
2724, she will tell you that something is hidden in the floorboards back where
you found her.  Examining those floorboards (room 2719) will reveal a hidden key
that allows passage through the glassygates into the Sorceress' palace area.
~
E

   The northern exit in room 2707 will normally repel you, causing you to sit
down if you try to enter.  When you stand up, the resident memlin will explain
that only the enslaved may enter.  This means..  You guessed it, you have to be
wearing the Goethite shackle to be allowed to pass.

The Mouth of an Obscured Cave~
   The huge slopes of an ancient mountain range tower above the landscape.  In
the side of the rocky wall a large gaping cave is almost obscured by the
surrounding trees.  A cold breeze, heavy with the smell of dust and damp wafts
from the opening, and a faint sound of clanging can be heard from within.
Large amounts of rubble are piled up at the entrance as though there has been a
lot of digging activity.

A Moist Cave~
   The large round cave is full of dust and disturbed debris.  Rough jagged
edges stick out from the stone walls as though it has been dug in a hurry, and
a thin slime coats every surface, sticky moisture hanging in the air.  From far
below, sounds of footsteps and the clanging of iron on rock can be heard.

Trickling Tunnel~
   This steeply sloping tunnel has only a frayed rope pegged along the wall to
aid in navigating it.  The ground is loose, and small stones bounce their way
down to the bottom at the slightest disturbance.  The air here is suffocatingly
humid and this is intensified by the wafts of heat coming from the lower end of
the passage.

A Gaping Intersection~
   There is a most unpleasant smell in this room, akin to that of rotten eggs,
which seems to be emanating from a nearby pile of rocks.  The floor is smooth
and looks to have been worn away rather than dug, indicating that this junction
has been passed through many times.  Sharp stalactites hang down like teeth
from the entrance of each connecting tunnel, giving the impression of standing
in a creature's jaws.

Beneath the Roots~
   This large passage is lined with the branching roots of an ancient tree.
Intertwined inseparably into the rock, the smaller offshoots have been pasted
to the cavern walls by a natural dribble of resin that has subsequently
hardened.  This gives the tunnel an almost gilded appearance, delicate veins of
smooth glassy amber lining its length.

A Dusty Supply Room~
   This appears to be a main supply room judging by the various things
cluttering the room.  Tools in various stages of rust and disrepair lean
against the walls, and heaps of straggled rope lie unused in what appears to be
an old mine cart.  This room is far smaller than is comfortable, and a
lingering cloud of dust makes it feel even more claustrophobic.  To the north a
small back door is partially covered by a ragged curtain.

A Curving Passage~
   This tunnel curves gently around, growing larger as it proceeds deeper into
the mountainside.  The walls and floor here have all been excavated more
carefully, sanded smooth and polished so that the silvery hue of the rock has a
metallic shine to it.  Somewhere nearby, several drops of liquid can be heard
dripping constantly onto rock.

they weep their way slowly down, collecting like a spreading wound on the
ground.

   Intense excavation here has made the cavern much higher than necessary for
even the tallest memlin.  Two towering quartz gates block further advancement
into the tunnel.  Diamond-hard and flawless, they seem strikingly out of place
in the dusty passage, illuminating it with refracted light.  Blood-red beryll
is embedded carefully into the glassy surface, inscribing some evil spell.

The Place of Gathering~
   A large and airy cavern, the dark ceiling glistens with tiny beads of
moisture as though star-lit.  A light grassy moss decorates the grooves along
the wall and floor, bearing the mark of tiny fading footprints and providing a
welcome scent of greenery that freshens the atmosphere.  A bubbling fountain

small row of towels are hung neatly to the side, along with some lumps of
sweet-smelling soap.

haze.  In the center of the room the enormous gelatinous mass of the Receptacle
pulsates slowly and continuously, surface contractions spreading down each of
the massive tentacles that reach in every direction.

Tentacle Tunnel~
   Several large tentacles snake their way up the walls like strange icy vines.
They become smaller as they reach outwards, all attaching to one parent tentacle
that throbs rhythmically, a vague stirring shape only just visible through the
semi-transparent surface.

Tentacle Tunnel~
   Spreading across the room like a network of glassy tree roots, several long
jellylike growths protrude from the west, quivering slightly and coating the
rocky floor and walls in a thin layer of slick, transparant slime.  A
particularly thick coating covers the central main tentacle, obscuring a clear
view of the shadowy movements within.

Tentacle Tunnel~
   A large semi-transparant growth extends from the north, almost more like a
pod than part of an organism, this womb-like structure pulses rhythmically.
Some form of stirring life can be seen inside, but the surrounding tissues are
too opaque to allow a close examination.

Tentacle Tunnel~
   A large gelatin limb extends from the east, rippling with peristaltic-like
waves as a blurry form moves within.  Several slimy offshoots sprout from the
center like spindley fingers, clawing their way up the slippery, jagged walls.

Fiery Hall~
   A large but somewhat rickety metal grid extends to the north, leaping flames
and billows of dark smoke rising from the molten chasm below, the intense heat
stifling the air and making it difficult to breathe.  Two large gates guard the
passage to the south.

An Abandoned Nursery~
   This is a child's room, the tiny bed and furnishings decorated with the
jewels and lace one would bestow upon a little girl.  Long abandoned, layers of
old gray dust cover the once beautiful surfaces of wood and satin.  Dreary
cobwebs linger in the corners like ghostly shadows, whispering silent words in
the cool breeze.

Chamber of Lyra~
   This entire room is an apparent tribute to the powerful Khan'li emotion of
Lyra, similar in expression to love, but more selfish and obsessive.
Flickering fire dances freely along the metal gilding in the wall, writhing and
changing into various humanoid forms as it fills the room with heat and a film
of moisture.  Scarlet symbols of passion and possession paint the floor and
ceiling alike, splashed liberally here and there like splatters of blood.

the air itself burning and shimmering like a blast from a powerful oven.

A Blazing Throne Room~
   Leaping tongues of fire dance all around the walls of this circular room, the
heat so intense that everything shimmers with waves of glistening evaporation.
Perfectly reflective metal flooring mirrors the writhing light, suspending the
entire contents of this massive room above the raging inferno below.  A great
throne stands in the center, formed magically from red beryll and studded with
glimmering blooddrop rubies.  A feeling of intense anger and energy fills the
air, tiny static sparks igniting randomly here and there.

The Foundation of All~
   Seemingly suspended in space through some illusion, the glass walls of this
curving room offer a spectacular panoramic view of the cosmos.  Blazing
meteorites and whirling planets dance continuously, twinkling stars bespeckling
the vast dark canvas of deep space.  Burning suns and icy moons light the
blackness, shimmering gaseous clouds sparkling with stardust and cosmic debris
as they wander past.

   Smooth and curving seamless walls seem almost to blur on approach as though

air and silvery blue veins of electricity lick around the borders of this room,
bright sparks randomly igniting like tiny winking fireflies.

Navi, the Will of the Imari~
   This large glass room extends from the south, the illusion of deep space
surrounding the frail shimmering walls.  Outside, the universe is blossoming
rapidly under the careful guidance of the immensely powerful concentrations of
life energy known as Imari.  Their forms can be seen as pure ripples of light,
wafting here and there amidst the stars like a breath of life, choreographing
the great cosmic dance and maintaining the equilbrium of order.  The exertion of
their efforts can be seen influencing all that exists, continuously pulling
everything to a state of balance, dark to light and light to dark.

Natul, Bringer of Life~
   Beyond the glass walls of this room, a great explosion of light can be seen
suspended in the midst of deep space, frozen in time and almost blinding in
intensity.  In its wake a small barren planet can be seen beginning to blossom,
the initial sprouts of growth and life coloring its dusky surface with splashes
of green, the nearby stars starting to glow brightly as if emblazened with
unnatural fire.

First Wave - the Cui~
   The near barren landscape of a vast planet stretches in all directions, only
the most primal fungi and mosses beginning to bloom.  Large footprints are
imprinted deeply into the ground though there appears to be very little life
around.  Only in the distance can the dark shapes of gigantic creatures be seen
moving slowly across the horizon.  In the sky, an enormously bright wave of
light can be seen slowly moving away into the recesses of space.

Tor~
   This room is dimly lit, dark shadows weaving around the forlorn surroundings.
A feeling of unnatural presence fills the air, and everything looks slightly
odd, as though peering through a bent glass.  Several paintings adorn the darkly
painted walls, all imagery of the forbidden union of Cui with Cui, and the
unnatural creature that is the consequence.

joining of Cui with their lesser Denuo kin, powerful and beautiful Ve offspring
populating the world.

can be seen moving across the terrain, a moderate glow of light sweeping
steadily across the sky.

   This room appears to be a Khan'li enclosure, black glistening goethite lining
the walls and floor and flickers of fire dancing freely about, controlled by
some invisible force.  The weapons of warriors are proudly displayed, sharp
spears and shining metal swords, the heat in this place making the air shimmer
as though merely a mirage.

   The stillness of this softly moss-covered area is broken only by the swaying
movement of the willow trees that grow here.  The sound of trickling water can
be heard gurgling amidst nearby rocks and leading into a small luminous pond.
Plant life blooms abundantly here, grasses and mosses covering every surface,
colorful flower blossoms and tree sprouts beginning to show through the green.

patch of moss.  Trickling water can be heard although not seen, and a film of
moisture covers the slick ceiling, sparkling stalactites beginning to form.

ground, the aftermath of a felling in recent years.  Brown grasses rustle
restlessly in the somewhat smoky air, and the peaks of a mountain range are
only just visible to the north.

Detta's Chamber~
   Warm hues of amber adorn the curving walls of this large subtly-lit room.
Against the northern side stands a beautiful bed, intricately carved from lush
cherry wood and spread with soft cream linen.  Several wall-hung candles
illuminate the room, serpentine tongues of firelight writhing upon the smooth
canvas of the bedsheets as shadows weave a sultry dance around the walls.  The
sweet scent of vanilla wafts in the air, mingled with the deeper, earthier aroma
of musk and gentle wood-wind music can only vaguely be heard beneath the
meditative murmuring of a central glass fountain, adding to the almost ethereal
tranquility of this place.
