At the South Gate to Ofingia~
   Looking south toward what should be the farming capitol of Dibrova, an
intense weight of sorrow for the men and women who farmed there, lived there,
loved there, and died there staggers you with the sheer immensity of the crimes
done them.  The sky which once was nearly always blue and clear is filled now
with char and soot, carried upon winds of smoke and ash from the goblin raids
which took this peaceful community by surprise.  The gate to the north always
stays closed and barred from the inside, vigilant guards on the ramparts
watching for any signs of trouble and bidding you a safe journey.

   *Shattered Farmlands of Ofingia
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova
Level: 8 - 15
94 rooms
13 mobs
27 objs
Connector Zones: Ofingia
After making Ofingia a Hometown on Dibrova and having it basically in
the middle of BFE, I decided it might be a good idea to stick a zone
in that would be close in proximity to Ofingia and have some mobs
available that were low level, made just for players fresh out of the
Newbie Zones.
This is not a very exciting area, I will be the first to admit. There
are a number of same-room descrips in this one that make the zone
slightly blah. The objs are all intended to be for lower level players,
same as the mobs. The plot is supposed to feed off the already existing
plot that Ofingia had from the start:
The goblins have the town under seige, they have ransacked these
farmlands in an attempt to prohibit the town from having any food
supplies. They constantly come in and loot and burn everything they
can find to further the town's losses. The Lord of Jareth has sent in
a retinue of his finest to help quell the threat, however they are
unaffective against the numbers of goblins in the area.
Hope you like it.

The Rocky Flatlands at the City Wall~
   Jagged rocks rise from their resting places in the earth the solid rock
formations being what Ofingia was built upon.  Just to south a ways, the rocks
taper off and open up a small valley where one of the many farmland fields of
this area are.  Of course, the fields are no longer as cared for as they once
were, being that every time any farmer makes an attempt at replanting a field, a
band of goblins come along and burn it to ash and kill the farmer.  The city
wall lies to the north - a tall, thick obstuction which is the town's only
defense against the goblin hoardes which attempt to overrun the town daily.

At the Wall of Ofingia~
   The southern wall of Ofingia stands tall and impregnable on the north side.
To the east, the jumbled upon which you stand drops off into a large field which
may once have been growing tall with corn but now only boasts a few scorched
stalks.  South is much the same, a steep drop off down into the burnt-out field.
It does not appear that the way down in either direction is safe - it is
recommended that another way be found.

Rocky Flatlands at the City Wall~
   On the north side the south wall of Ofingia rises thirty feet up, solid and
unyielding.  Stolid faces look down upon you from the ramparts, faces of men and
women who have known much pain and injustice from the goblins who continually
raid this town.  To the south and west are steep rocky drop-offs, too steep for
climbing.  They lead down into the farming area, where the soil is rich and
strong when its not being burnt by goblins or trampled by the feet of marching
soldiers.

At the City Wall~
   The wall of Ofingia rises high on the north side, the way kept blocked by the
impenetrable wall which the citizens have fortified and refortified against
goblin intrusion.  The ground here is rocky and without growth, the rock bed
which Ofingia was built upon stands higher than the rest of the land around it.

The Outer Rocklands of Ofingia~
   This is the far southwest edge of the rocklands which Ofingia was built upon.
To the south and west the rocklands drop steeply away down into the farming land
which Ofingia is so famous for.  Stone causeways riddle passage on higher ground
through the farmlands, seperating each field with a solid wall of rock and scree
which is used as the main roadway.  The town of Ofingia lies to the north.

A Breathtaking View~
   The start of the walkway begins here, the tall manmade rock causeway that
spans over most of the farming area of Ofingia.  From this height, most of the
farmlands and the small homes within those areas can be seen.  At one time, an
artist could probably have been struck with wonder and awe at the beauty of this
vast, organized farming area.  Now the fields - once green and verdant with life
- are burnt and smoking.  Farmhouses have been all but erradicated by the roving
hoardes of giblins from the mountain caverns to the north.  The causeway leads
south into the smoke and soot or north toward the city.

On the Causeway~
   To the east and west the rock slopes downward into farming areas, where the
field are burnt and twisted from the ravages of battle.  Occassionally in the
fields below, a figure or two can be seen running crouched over from one spot to
another trying not be seen.  Small pockets of fighting can be heard if not seen
in the areas below.  It is rumored that the Lord of Jareth sent reinforcements
for the town to try and eliminate the threat of the goblins, maybe that is what
the sounds are from.

A Split in the Causeway~
   A small, almost unfinished section of the causeway runs off to the east
running through a smaller set of fields.  It appears that maybe this fields were
just recently cultivated before the raids began.  Now, of course, they are in
ruin - smoking and burnt almost beyond repair.  To the south, a wider stretch of
the causeway runs south through some of the larger and more profitable fields of
the area.

time when the raids began or else it was destroyed by the raids, broken down
into its current state by goblins intent on destroying everything in their path.

area.

The End of the Causeway~
   It appears that it may be possible to climb east down the rubble onto the
flat farmlands from this elevated position, however if you wish to stay upon the
causeway with a good vantage point you will have to head back to the west.  As
it is now, the causeway has broken down to the point where it is only five feet
higher at the most than the fields it runs through.

   Chunks of stone and rubble lie scattered, as if someone were still working on
extending this section of the causeway further into the fields to make room for
more farming.  To the south, an enormous field of scorched earth strectches
toward the horizon, the same true of the blackened fields to the north.  You may
climb back up onto the causeway to the west if that is your intent.

where the Eastern Causeway meets another, splitting off to the east and west.

stone walkway is clear and wide, large enough to accomodate a couple of wagons
side by side.  The only obstruction is the occassional body part or stray piece
of armor that has fallen from the battles fought through this area.

The Southeastern Corner~
   The Eastern Causeway ends at this point, another section of it heading west
through more of the farmlands.  To the south is a fairly large plot of land
owned and farmed - until recently - by Jon Boggins, the first farmer in this
area.  His land is now scorched and ruined with no hope of a crop for at least a
couple more years until the soil repairs itself.  The folk of Ofingia have only
seen Jon once since the raids began, when he came into town to ask for military
help from the mayor.  Jon's farm was the first hit by the raids, and the mayor
thought that it would be a one-time occurance.  Since the town forces were
already fighting in the caverns east of town and were few in number to start
with, the mayor refused Jon his help.  Jon spit in the mayor's face and vowed
never to pay another dime in taxes.  The only communication from Jon was a cart
bearing his farm's crest sent into town bearing the remains of Jon's son.

through the smoke and ash drifting in the wind if there isn't some goblin or

you throat out and eat you whole.

Private Causeway~
   At one time - not too long ago - this section of the farming area was owned
and kept by Scorfahr, the richest of the farmers in the Ofingian farmlands due
to the immense size of his fields and the quality of the soil with which he
produced the most plentiful crops year after year.  Scorfahr was killed right at
the outset of the raids by a roaving band, his farm burnt to the ground.

have his own ingress and egress to his home without having to deal with the
common farmhands who frequented the main causeway.  A sloping path leads down to
the north into the field and homestead where Scorfahr used to reside.  His home,
once the largest and most opulent home in the farmlands, is now no more than a
burnt out shell - still smoking.

   This could very well be the last remaining structure that stands with four
walls in this entire farmland area.  For some unknown reason the goblins left it
standing and when the fires passed by in the fields outside, it did not ignite.
This would probably be a very good place to rest if that were your desire.

the east.  To the south is the heaping pile of what is left of the barn and
farmhouse that used top be here.

A Crude Barricade~
   The heaped remains of the farmhouse and barn - that which hasn't been burned
to ash - has been erected into a barricade against goblin intrusion.  A large
hole has been dug in the earth to accomodate more space and protection from the
cold nights.  All of this is butt up against the rock wall of the valley on the
east side.  To north and west are the burnt and scorched fields.

with all sorts of finery and goods, you must wonder what Scorfahr thought in his
last moments.  All of his wordly goods, all of his wealth meant nothing as the
goblins ransacked his home, killed his family and ate chunks of his flesh as he
watched himself die.  Only a few timbers and stone remain of this once-awesome
place.
