Sea of Souls~
   You feel your ship being carried with the current of the sea.  You can see
several large boulders sticking up from the depths of the water.  Where could
these enormous rocks have come from?  Be careful not to hit one, you wouldn't
be likely to survive.

   As you continue floating across the vast sea, you spot an island not to far
off to the south.  The island looks bigger than the rest that you have seen.
What could be there?

Dragon Isle~
   Dragons roam this island.  It's a known fact that people who enter this
island never leave it.  Maybe you should leave before you are spotted as
someone's lunch.

footprints in the sand.  You step inside of one, and suddenly feel very scared.
You're not alone here.

death.

be possible?  The climate is much too warm for there to be snow.  All the
plants have died and shrivled up, leaving you as the only living thing on this
island.
