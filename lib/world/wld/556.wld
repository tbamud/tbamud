are in the process of clearing the desert of those annoying
sandtraps.  Unfortunately one of my men had wandered into the
dragon cave and was slayed by that evil creature.  We need
another knight, and also he had a moonstone.  Thank you, my
liege.

   @n
Pilgrim,
     You have reached the final step on your way to enlightenment.
In this last step you will be shown ultimate evil to your north,
and ultimate good to your south.  This is the land of the undead.

   The dead of both those whose goodness links them to the land,
and those whose evilness was rejected are here.  To have true
spirituality one must know both.  Once you have been strengthened
and forge through the evil, there is one final test before you
prove yourself equal to the Avatar himself.  You must endure
the test of time.
