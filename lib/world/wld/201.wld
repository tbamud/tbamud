Elixias's Zone Description Room~
   @RLocation@n: A few island in the middle of the ocean @BPurpose@n: For people
to explore, from the sandy beaches to the hidden coves.  From deep underwater to
the deserted island where Leviathius the son of Leviathan resides.  It's a
lowbie exp zone too, with crabs that appear more frequently at night and
agressive jellyfishes that floats in the shallow waters.  There's no plot, but
when hunting becomes boring players can always stroll down here and explore the
area.  ;) @YSize@n: Size?  There's 50 rooms steeped with lots of trigs.  Things
to note: Immortals, please turn nohassle off, or errors will occur OR you may
not be able to enjoy the full experience of this zone.  If you are caught by the
siren, simple type @Rgoto siren@n and purge siren.  You can also try to logon as
another human character and ask for an imm to help ;)

In the Deep Waters~
   In the distance to the northeast is Konolua beach, a small island in the
middle of the sea.  Here, the waves are fierce and hungry, reaching out at you
in an attempt you swallow you.  To the north, are shallow waters, while
everywhere else are large bodies of ocean.

In the Ocean~
   The ocean is a deep blue, and the waves here are strong.  It is impossible to
look into the depths of the ocean, for the shifting bodies of the sea makes it
difficult to.  To the north you can descry a small island.

   The wind tears and howls, inflicting its wrath against you and the vast
ocean.  North are safer and much calmer waters, while to the other directions
the ocean continues.

   The water is a deep blue color and looks threateningly deep.  Howling winds
come in all direction, invoking the rage of the waves.  To the north the sea is
calmer, while to the east, south and west the ocean continues.

Underwater~
   You are beneath the surface of the ocean.  The currents under here are
strong, pulling and forcing you to go deeper.  The depths of the sea is great.
It is deep, so deep that there is only inky darkness at the bottom.
Surrounding you are nothing, just lots and lots of seawater...
