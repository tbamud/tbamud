At the gates of the Grand City of Hannah~
   You have come to the entrance of the Grand City of Hannah.  The iron gates
are rusted but still look sturdy.  You hear grunting noises and high pitched
shrills coming from within the city.  You think to yourself that you need to be
ready for anything as you enter the gates.  An old sign is here, depicting a
map of the city.

Temple Square~
   You have reached the center most part of the city of Hannah.  Beautifully
designed shops and marketplaces line the streets.  Although they are in ruins
you can tell that someone took a lot of time designing and building them.  As
you sit back and sip the cool, clear water from the fountain you silently
wonder to yourself what kind of barbarians would destroy such a lovely place.

Intersection of Main Street and High Street~
   You have come upon yet another intersection.  To the south you see main
street and the Temple of Hannah.  High Street runs east and west from here.
You are still amazed at the carnage that must have taken place here a long time
age as skeletal remains are shoveled up into large piles everywhere.  Someone
or something must really care about this city to be working so hard to clean
it.

A hall in the Temple~
   Large picture windows line this hallway.  This is the first time you've been
able to see the destruction that has occurred in the city.  The town is in
complete ruins.  As you look below you see Assassins attacking Korreds and orcs
wondering aimlessly through out town.  You wonder to yourself if this town will
ever be the way it once was.
