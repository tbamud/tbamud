MouseRider's Temple~
   The inside of this temple is austere yet majestic.  The pillars of
marble sweep up to the ceiling, melting into the dome overhead without
a seam.  A blazing red carpet leads from the entrance to the throne in
the center of the room.  This is truly the home of a great sage!

Kerofk is 153 rooms big. Replace all instances of 'XXXX' with some
deity, god or imp's name.  Whatever.
Edit room 2#46 to connect with somewhere mountainous in your mud.
Exits can be joined to this room from the west, or from the south.
Finish the last line in the room description to reflect this exit.
Check the following items to make sure the value used
for spells conforms to the same spell on your mud.
*#00 -- Identify (53)
*#02 -- Fireball (26)
*#08 -- Armor (1)
*#09 -- Teleport (2)
*#18 -- Bless (3)
*#19 -- Invisibility (29)
*#20 -- Blindness (4)
*#21 -- Sleep (38)
*#36 -- Cure Critical (15)
Add specials, if desired, for the mobs listed in the 'notes' section.
Add these two rooms to your 'reception' special: #45 & #64.
*
Edit Room 2#29 to look like your login screen. (you'll understand
once you look at it...)
*
Here are some recommended specials for the mobs:
*
Guildmasters: Mage (#02), Thief (#04), Cleric (#27) and Warrior (#29).
Spellcasters: #02, #34, #41, #44.
#38 & #39 were 'boss'-mobs of the quest, and should be given tough
spellcasting routines, such as healing themselves, removing sanct's...
whatever you can think of which seems unnecessary.  The power of the
items in that section make it more than worth the risk. Mob #00 had a
nice speaking routine, and basically commented about the weather, made
vague remarks about the future, and the following quest based remarks:
'Great power will go to the destroyer of the orb!' 'The Blue Temple
houses an orb of utter evil!' and other such tripe.  A sign can do
just as well, if desired.

Big thankee's to Tarkin of VieMud (viemud.org 4000) who codes

of George Essl's Dikued program. Even more thanks to the brothers of
FORCE and all the players at VieMud, for some of the most painful
playtesting ever seen.

MouseRider's Bedroom~
   This can hardly be a bedroom--this is a room so spartan surely no
human could spend any time here at all!  There is a small pallet in
one corner, with a chair and a paper-stand next to it.  A small lamp
lights up that small area, leaving the rest of the room enshrouded in
darkness.  In the gloom to the west, you can barely make out a large
steel door.

Plaza of Kerofk~
   This is the center of Kerofk, physically and culturally.  Many
people are here, milling about and standing in line to enter the great
white temple to your north.  To the south is a smaller blue temple,
its doors locked by great bands of magic.  Several people glare at
you, wondering if you're going to cut through the line.

The Blue Temple~
   You enter the temple, looking around with wonder at the dusty
monument's interior.  From the carvings and inscriptions, you guess
that it was built by elves and dwarves together during a peaceful age
long ago.  Dust covers almost everything, especially the stairs
leading down into the earth by the nave.

attempt to get all they have to do done as fast as possible.  Bump Oof
Excuse Me!  There is a Mage's Guild to the north.

   This is the intersection of Citizen Road and Center Road.  The
pedestrians file past each other with practiced ease.  You have no
clue how to get across...  Wait, there's an opening!  Sprint, Turn,
Jab!  Run, Run, Run...  you're across! You look up at the never-ending
twilight and wonder how so many people could bear to live here.

The Red Card~
   This place is a dirty ugly scroungy disgusting gambling parlor for
the lowest of classes.  The doors to the Red Card are perpetually
open, to let the place air out.  Tired waitresses take orders in a
bored fashion, and then hasten to fill them before the customers
leave.  Something crunches under your step, and you're afraid to look
down to see what it was....stay awhile?

Intersection at the Cliff's Edge~

   Cliffside?
   About fifteen feet ahead of you there is a sheer precipice that
drops down about a thousand feet into the dark ocean.  You don't think
it would be a good idea to step off, but you've already guessed that,
haven't you?
   Cliffside Road runs north and south from here.

   This looks like an interesting spot.
   As you hug the buildings to keep away from the thousand foot drop
to your east (that would surely KILL you), you notice a large casino
establishment named 'The Edge of Luck' to the west.  Strangely enough,
the citzenry of Kerofk walk up and down the street, almost oblivious to
the incredible drop mere feet away.
   Cliffside Road continues North and South.

   Here is where Cliffside Road and Moon Gate Road meet: at the edge
of a cliff.  You feel distinctly uncomfortable as you look down at the
thousand-foot drop and think it would not be very wise to go any
further east.  Northwards is Cliffside Road, to the west is Moon Gate
Road, and to the east a vast expanse of stars shine over the dark
ocean below.

Cliffhanger looks good, though.

go to blow off steam and lose lots of money.  The whole place is
decorated in shades of red, and most of the windows face the nearby
cliff-- evidently to give the gamblers within that feeling of danger.
The elegance is fabulous, and you feel as if you might want to join

Benzaldehyde's Office~
   This office is quite opulent.  The huge ebony desk in front of you
completely dominates the room.  The desk is cluttered as the mind is
sharp; Benzaldehyde is no fool.  A few pictures on the wall of family
members show that Ben might have a nice side, but you suspect that
they are there just for show.  A few vicious exotic weapons are also
hanging up, looking very sharp.

Bob's Armory and Tackle~
   This place has to be the WEIRDEST shop you've ever been in.
Fishing poles and halberds decorate the walls.  Breast plates stacked
with cups of nightcrawlers on top.  Bow strings and fishing line, etc,
etc, etc.  The shopkeeper has made this nightmare somewhat homey,
though, with doileys and pictures scattered about in a pleasing
display.

The Fortress~
   Wow! This place is better defended that some castles you've seen.
In case Kerofk ever falls, this place will surely be the last to go,
for this inn lives up to its name: 15 foot high walls, crenellations,
arrow slits...its a remarkable bit of engineering.  As you walk in,
you notice that everyone here is carrying some sort of weapon, and
carry themselves like they know how to use it.  Seems like a fairly
safe place!

The CliffHanger~
   This drinking establishment is placed a little too close to the
edge of the cliff for your own comfort--about five feet close!  You
briefly pray to Rumble, asking for no earthquakes in the immediate
future.  As you look around, you see lots of people passed out on the
floor--this is obviously a lower class dive.  The room is dark, the
people sweaty, the barmaids tired, and you want a drink.

History of Kerofk~
   This is an 'accidental room', provided only for room continuity.
   And so, the history of Kerofk...
   The city of Kerofk originated in the mind of Builder_5, as a major
city for use in a role-playing game he was running at the time (a
heavily modified version of Powers & Perils--a very out-of-print
Avalon Hill game).  Amanda Eterniale was a player in this game, and
loved the city.
   About this time, Amanda received an invitation to build on the
now-defunct AlbertMUD.  She was taught how to build by an imp
named MJPrime there, and her first creation was the city of Kerofk,
in honor of Builder_5's game.
   AlbertMUD died in a fairly nasty manner, and about half a year
later, Amanda convinced one of the imps to email her her areas.  She
gave them to Builder_5, smiled, and said,
   "Edit these?  Please?"
   Builder_5 took the better part of 3 months to edit, fix, and convert
these files into a version more suitable for a public release.  This
is what you have now.
   Both of us hope you enjoy this area, over a year in the making...
        Amanda Eterniale                        Builder_5

Shrine to the Emperor~
   This is a very historical spot for the people of Kerofk, where the
wizard Rand entered this realm through the 'dimension portal' he made,
and later went on to found this city. A giant slab of earth lies
toppled over here, a strange eye-shaped stone embedded in it pointing
at the sky.  A strange thrum of power in the background raises your
hackles...remnants and echoes of Rand's power, evidently.

indicate that several people have inhabited this house still, fairly
recently in fact.  A once-ornate grand stairway leads up to the second
floor, and below it's peak is a set of cracked glass doors that open
up into the backyard.  The hall of the house leads north-south,
gaining access to some of the interior rooms.

inside the house, although there is a looming presence from the garden
area opening up to your west.  A slight stench of decay passes over
you, and you consider going back inside the house to your east.

Entrance to the Garden~
   Starlight gives this ill-seeming garden illumination, the dim
twinkling giving the illusion of movement to the plantlife within.
All around you vines crawl up decaying trellises and the other
vegetation grows out of control, untended.  You hear a gentle swishing
of water to a northernly direction, and you can go deeper into the
garden to the east, but you definitely think going west might be the
best idea...

Hallway~
   This hallway was once tapestried in beautiful colors, and well-

thread-worn and moth-eaten and most the lamps have disappeared,
leaving dark holes in the walls.  There is a door to your left and one
to your right, both slightly ajar.  A window to your north looks out
to an alley behind a gambling parlor, and to the south is the main

tracks in the dust on the floor.  There are doors to the east and
west, and northwards is the main room of the mansion.  A window once
graced the south end of this hallway, but it has since been boarded up
from the outside.

Dining Room~
   This was once a grand dining hall.  Now the great oak table has
been completely broken and leaned up against one wall to make room for
a small folding table and a few chairs taking its place.  Obviously
the current owners of this mansion don't care much about this place to
let it fall into ruin so.

Second Floor Hallway~
   This is the hallway at the top of the stairs, that leads
north-south.  Doors line the hallway in both directions, and you can
go down to the main room.  A big, ten foot tall window on the west
wall of the stairwell seemed to have been a stained-glass window once,
but has been worn and cracked by time to just be shards of colored
glass that doesn't even keep the wind out.

Kitchen~
   As all the other rooms in this house, this kitchen has been mostly
destroyed by time and inconsideration by the current owners.  There is
still some fresh food lying about, but a rotten smell fills the air,
and you see small insects scuttling about in the trash on the floor.
The one thing that is sure is that you don't want to eat anything that
was prepared here!

Hallway~
   This hallway ends short to allow the fireplace in the kitchen to
reach the roof.  A single door is set in the east wall, and the hall
leads north to where the stairwell leads down.

Bedroom~
   This bedroom has been made up for two people.  There are bunk beds
in the center of the room, and different sets of run-down furniture on
each side.  On the right is a rather neat desk, chair, a chest of
drawers, and on the left there is just a mess of clothes, papers,
books, and half-eaten food.  There isn't much interesting here,
though.

Hallway~
   This hall leads to the northern part of the second floor, where two
bedrooms lead off to the east and west.  There is nothing remotely
interesting here, since the general decrepency of the house is now no
longer 'new' to you.  Another window looks out over top a gambling
parlor to the north, where you see several low-life types walking and
staggering in and out.  The starlight filtering in through the window
makes this hall a bit more illuminated than the rest of the house.

Guest Bedroom~
   This is a tiny little room, about 6 feet square and containing only
a small bed, a small night-table and a stepladder leaning against the
wall in one corner.  A lot of disturbed dust on the floor makes you
wonder what this room is being used for, since it is obvious no one
has used the bed for a _long_ time.

Bedroom~
   You would guess that a young woman lives in this room, from the
quality and newness of the clothes that are stacked neatly in the open
hope-chest, and the different cosmetics lined up on a shelf just below
a mirror on the far wall.  A small sleeping pallet lies rolled-up on
the floor neatly, and you notice that there is hardly any dust
anywhere in this room, making it seem somewhat 'fresh' despite the
run-down-ness of the rest of the household.

Attic~
   This is the attic of the house.  There are shelves built into the
sides of the roof all around with strange objects floating in jars
stacked on them.  The smell of formaldehyde is very strong here and
you begin to feel faint.  There's a door built into a partition to the
south...maybe you can make it...

jar jars~
   Um, the more you look at this jar, the more the thing floating
inside begins to look at a piece of human anatomy.  *urp* You are
beginning to feel _very_ ill.

Bedroom~
   Something smells quite dead here.
   There is a queen-sized bed taking up most of this small attic
room. Some clothes are spread about in disorder and the bed isn't
made.  A single chair is pulled up to a writing desk, where it looks
like someone works frequently.  Up here it is very chill, much colder
than it is outside.
