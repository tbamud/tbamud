Entrance to the Asylum Grounds~
   The pitted black gate lies just to the north, the crumbling stone wall
running off east and west from the gate.  It is a wonder the gate is still
functional, so old and decrepit it seems.  South is what used to be the main
entryway to a large compound of some sort, one that seems almost scholastic in
appearance, but more somber - more militaristic.  In any case, it is certainly
no longer in use, and has not been for some time.

Connector Zones: The Plains of Blood
This is set in the grounds of an old insane asylum which X'Raantra
took for his own use. X'Raantra hears a voice in his head -he is a
nutball- this voice he hears, he takes to be the Lord Almighty. The
voice tells him that only through human sacrifice will he ascend
through the gates of Heaven. X'Raantra, though obviously crazy, is
extremely enigmatic and has been able to gather a good number of people
to join in his cult which is centered in the ruins of this old asylum.
There are a few spec_procs I added to a couple of mobs - just for
effect, really. The zone probably will not lack without these procs.

At the Old Fountain~
   A fountain, dry and cracked and blackened by grime and dirt, stands in the
center of this small court.  The fountain boasts the figure of a man standing
proudly in the center, a thick tome tucked under his one arm and the other hand
holding onto his lapels.  There is still some sort of liquid at the bottom of
the fountain, but it does not appear to be safe for consumption.

The Asylum Grounds~
   Large buildings surround every side, paths which once must have been well
tended are now choked with weeds and run between these buildings and around
them.  Two very square-ish looking buildings lie to the east and the west, a
smaller and taller building lying to the south.  To the north is, of course, the
exit from this place.  The door to the southern-most building lies directly
south from here.

The Asylum Grounds~
   The tall weeds cover most of the masonry that used to cover the ground here,
only small patches of stonework still visible through the tangle.  Once upon a
time, this place must have been some sort of well-funded institution.  What
could have happened to cause it to be left in this state, one can only imagine.

The Asylum Grounds~
   The ground beneath was very obviously once cobbled entirely in this small
court, the stones still prohibiting growth in many small spots throughout.  A
long two story building lies to the east, its main doors just east from here,
one of them swinging on its hinge at a crazy angle.  Looking closely at the
door, there can be seen a smear of blood near the handle and on the framework
around the handle.  A jumbled path leads south between the buildings.

The Asylum Grounds~
   Close by to the west is the door to a long two story building made of carved
stone.  The court around you must once have been quite a sight with the fountain
in the center and the surrounding buildings, however someone or something caused
all of this to be abandoned and left to rot into its current state.  Perhaps
funding ran out, perhaps a disease.  One can only surmise.

   A long two story building runs along north and south, forming the western
boundary of this court.  To the south is a path leading around the buildings of
the court heading farther back into the asylum's area.  At this angle, south
along the path and somewhat behind the southern building a light of some sort
flickers.

Inner Hall of the Academy~
   The floor of this building is made from some of concrete that was once white
concrete.  It is now stained black from the years of disuse and neglect, the
elements getting a solid hold on its degradation.  A door lies on the east wall,
a small hole cut in upper center area where it appears there might once have
been glass placed.  The hallway runs north from here, a thin trail of old blood
running along the length of the floor.

   The hall here looks much the same as the hall to the south, the grime making

trail of blood continues north to the end of the hall and leads into yet another
door there.

dark to see what may be inside.  The hall runs south into the darkness, back
toward the exit.  A set of concrete stairs lead up into the darkness, their
steps covered in litter and rubble.

Classing Room~
   This small twenty foot by twenty foot room was once used as a room for
teaching some sort of education to the pupils which resided at this asylum.
There is an old blackboard, broken at one corner, still attached to the south
wall and the desks and chairs which used to seat the pupils are still nailed
solidly to the floor.  Obviously, if the chairs and desks had to be nailed to
the floor there was a need for forced discipline.

Classing Room~
   This small room holds three rows of chairs and desks, all of them five desks
wide.  The chairs face south to a large blackboard and an open area before it
that must have been where a teacher's desk would have been placed.  There is no
such desk now.  The chairs and desks remain only because they were bolted into
the floor of the room, made so as to enforce discipline the old fashioned way.

   This small room holds three rows of chairs and desks, all placed exact in

however the plaster has cracked time and time again, leaving gaping holes where
once smooth clean walls stood.  Lewd scrawlings adorn the walls where they still
hold any sort of flat surface, sure evidence that this place may not completely
be deserted.

scrawlings~
   You try and make out as much of the words as you can but most of them have
faded into smudges.  Words such as mother and whore are generally
repeated as well as some short poetry.  One reads Here I sit all broken
hearted, tried to shit but only, and then it too becomes too faded to tell
what follows.  Must have been quite important - possibly runes of some sort.

Upper Hall~
   Strange that there are no windows in this entire building, it would seem that
a building of this size made entirely of brick and mortar would get extremely
warm without ventilation.  There is a door on the east wall, the hall itself
runs south for a short distance and terminates.

   The hall ends with a door to the west.  The door stands open, propped by the
floor as it hangs by only one hinge.  The rubble strewn about on the floor from
the building's decay makes movement through this area quite difficult.  The
blood soaked into the plastered walls and rubble strewn floors does not do much
to bolster the ego, either.

cleared quite recently as although there is a great deal of rubble strewn about,
the way through it all is not in any way prohibitive, as if a path had been
cleared.  To the south a flickering light of some sort can be seen.  To the east
is the entryway into a small, low building made of stone.

future.  A crude stone foundation with no roof lies just to the west.

crumbling stone gazebo set in the middle of a huge courtyard.  The courtyard is
surrounded by darkened buildings, all of which show signs of decay.  There are
humanoid shaped moving all about the courtyard, some appear as if they might be
dancing, others appear to be going about specified tasks.  In the gazebo there
are a number of people as well, all of which swaying in unison to some as yet
unheard sound.  In looking down on the floor of the courtyard and even on this
path, blood can be seen spilled in huge quantities all over the stone.  It
almost appears as if it were poured on the stone in an attempt to saturate the
entire area.

moving about around that fire.  All along in the courtyard are also people who
seem to be about some sort of business, whether swaying in some ritual of some
sort of going about a task of some sort, they are many.

The Gazebo Steps~
   Now the source of the light in the gazebo is plain to see - a flickering
torch is thrust into a stone holder, a makeshift altar next to it.  A man
dressed in dark blood-soaked robes kneels before the altar, arms upraised in
prayer - a curved dagger clenched tightly in one upraised fist.

Asylum Courtyard~
   The courtyard ends at its westernmost boundary, a long low building marking
that boundary.  The entrance to the building lies just south, a set of tall
steps leading up into its dark interior.  Just behind the building a tall water
tower can be seen rising up into the night sky.

Entrance to a Building~
   A very official looking building, at least it would look official had it not
red blood stains covering the outer walls, lies to the west.  A set of double
doors lie open at crazy angles, the interior dark and mysterious.  Straight to
the east is a set of steps leading up to a stone gazebo.

X'Raantra's Altar~
   The floor of the gazebo is stone, like the rest of the edifices which make up
this asylum, and is sunk in roughly a foot from the edges.  This sunken area
forms a sort of a pool, which was probably not the original intent of the
builders, which is filled to the rim with thick, dark blood.  Torches are thrust
into holders on the supports of the gazebo's ceiling, four of them in number
lighting this terrible place all too well.

which has withstood the ravages of time and looters.  The wood must once have
been very beautiful with its carved cherubs and angels floating about on its
surface, but now those angels are smeared in blood, their faces ghastly and
horrific in the flickering light.  The steps up to the gazebo in the center of
the courtyard lie just west.

the function of which unfathomable from this room.

   The stone hooks still jut from the walls where the clergy must once have hung
or donned their robes of office before or after a service.  There are, of
course, no robes hanging from those hooks any longer.  This room, like most of
the other rooms in the buildings of this asylum, has succumbed to the demand of
time and decay, the walls crumbling and the floors broken and cracked.  All of
this is, of course covered in a sheen of red.

upward reveals that this tall shaft leads directly up into the bell tower, as
the bell is visible even from here on the ground level.  A set of ropes hang
down, their frayed ends high out of reach.  They must once have connected to
something here, but whatever that was, it is long since rotted or taken.

Chapel Worship Room~
   There are spots where rows of pews once lined before a carved stone altar,
however all that is left of the majesty of the place are two pews and the
remains of the altar, tipped to the side and split asunder.  It would only
appear the work of vandals or looters if not for the immense amounts of blood
soaked into the stonework of the place.  This was a calculated ruination of a
place of worship.

Bell Tower~
   It turns out that the shaft leading up from the interior of the chapel is
actually the bell tower itself.  A bird's eye view of the asylum is given here,
especially of the courtyard where it is now painfully obvious that there are
many more people moving about this place.  On the north wall is a window which
leads out just above the roof of the chapel.  It does not appear that the tower
would be accessible again once exited from and onto the chapel roof.

   There is not much of interest on this roof save for the fact that it is the

and trash that is littered about the ground and in the buildings.  It must be
too much effort for the vandals of this area to climb out here and trash this
part as well.  It appears that the only way from this rooftop is down, jumping
from the roof to the courtyard below.

wall, all rusted into uselessness.  Like every other section of this asylum, the

heavily on rain water to help replenish their supplies of water whenever nature
was kind.  This small platform runs around near the utmost top of tower, a wire
mesh affair that feels none-too-sturdy.

Cracked Path~
   The path leads into a burnt out ruin of a building, one which was obviously
not made of stone like the rest of this place.  All that remains, or so it
appears, of the place is the chimney which still stands tall with a fireplace at
the base.

Ruins of a Building~
   The ground is covered in charred pieces of wood and debris.  No growth at all
grows here, as the burning stunted that growth for many years yet to come.  A
tall stone fireplace rises to the west.

Ruins of a Building~
   The ground is covered in charred pieces of wood and debris.  No growth at all
grows here, as the burning stunted that growth for many years yet to come.  A
stone chimney with a fireplace at the base is all that is left of whatever sort
of building might once have stood here long ago.
