A short rockslide~
   You stand amidst a tumble of rocks of various sizes and shades of gray and
ebony.  A pale hawk circles overhead, uttering a shivering cry.  It is
impossible to continue downwards without meeting an untimely (?  ) death.  A
few homes have been hidden here in the cliff face, a bit of a hike from any
civilization.

credits info~
   Sundhaven is designed to be a newbie starting town, essentially
an alternative to a time-worn Midgaard. It is complete with the guilds
of the four basic classes, shops, bank, post office, and several
connecting points which make it easy to link to any world.
SPECS:
guilds:  {CLASS_WARRIOR, 6757, SCMD_WEST},
         {CLASS_THIEF, 6740, SCMD_EAST},
         {CLASS_MAGIC_USER, 6616, SCMD_UP},
         {CLASS_CLERIC, 6661, SCMD_WEST},
   Room 6602 may function as a donation room if you desire.
Room 6601 may serve as a player loadroom, with the following
equipment loading with new players:
      objs 6602, 6603, 6604 to all.
      obj 6605 to thieves  (dagger).
      obj 6606 to mages  (staff).
      obj 6607 to clerics  (mace).
      obj 6608 to warriors  (short sword).
   I hope you find the zone useful.

Zone 272 is linked to the following zones:

   A little trail picks its way among small ill-anchored stones and patches of
black, wiry grass, that at first site gives the place a ravaged, charred look.
However, the vegetation is living, just endowed with a dark hue.

A small haunted grove~
   With the exception of the inexplicable darkness permeating this grove, there
is little way to explain the odd feeling of foreboding about this place.  No
birds sing, no rat scurries in the open, the leaves rustle barely enough to
break the silence.  Yet an odd presence makes itself felt.

eastward arcs.  There is little that is extraordinary about this place.  It is
deserted, it is lonely, yet a particularly green bluff forms a plateau just
above you.  It calls to you in an eerie way, yet emits a chaotic aura that
might be best left alone.

yet can on the mortal world, and giving the bluff its name.

Some images have been carved and charred in by a fiery touch, a sternly
beautiful woman with a ruby dagger sheathed at her waist stands beside a man
with the robe of the priesthood.  The cold wind of the sea blows the sails of
the rocking ship they ride upon.  The rogue woman is imploring a second man to
destroy a beast far too great for his strength, a cruel smile playing upon her
lips.  The image is frozen upon the bark, immobile, yet it is apparent she is
winning the battle.  Beneath the picture are engraved the words "Know thy

you in slightly with each step.  A rotten stench is filtering in from the west,
repelling you in another direction automatically such that it takes a great
conscious effort for you to turn that way.  The path heads north into the
town's mainstream, and south closer to the wildlands beyond it.

and the poisons of roguish assassins bubble and float in jars crowded onto

A voodoo doll pinned to one wall seems to be eyeing you.  Let's hope you are

The Assassin Hideout~
   The hideout of rogues is surprisingly comfortable.  Although no refuge from
the blood and risk of their everyday existence, it is nevertheless a haven in
which bounties can be split and repose taken by a warm fireplace hung with
guild daggers, skillfully tapered and too hot from the flames to steal.  A bar
sunken into the far stone wall assists your dexterity..  So it is said..  And
bunks are layer the area to the east, hung with stolen tapestries and sheets.

of the trade.  A hanging row of the spines of previous victims covers the east
wall, scarred with the dagger twists of countless thieves perfecting their
backstab.  You may have to travel far in search of more fine-tuned skills, but
the guildmistress is willing to give newcomers their start in the art of
fiends.

Slippery stone steps~
   The darkness of a steep stairwell encloses you.  The dripping and oozing
sounds of slime creeping down the walls is barely detectable beneath the sounds
of your own breathing.  There seems to be tracks of footfalls in the slime
coating the steps..  Evidently this serves as a secret passageway, regularly
used, for some individuals of a shady nature.

   Dark brambles hung with dully shining berries form condensed hedges, growing
in lines and stretching their thorny tendrils across your path.  The limbs
trail low, heavy with fruit in temperate climate.  High stone walls protect
this precious bower from the destructive noise and thoughts of ordinary humans.

A dark corner of the tavern~
   The loners of Sundhaven gather here (figure *that* one out) to mourn their
losses over gallons of liquid spirits.  Occasionally, one can be seen passed
out on the floor, robbed by some thief slipping in from the Nightbreak, but
generally the livers here are stout from long and weary experiences.

   The home lodge of warriors is a surprisingly comfortable place, furnished
with a thick, hardy rug of a red so dark as to almost be black, beds shelved in
bunks of hearty oak, a roaring fireplace in the corner.  Several large chairs
stuffed with coarse wool are situated round the fire for the rowdy telling of
tales over inebriating brews.

The Sanctuary~
   The walls of the sanctuary of those of a priestly bent are indefinite,
seemingly rounded and blurred by a muted pale light that seems to come from
nowhere.  It is perhaps a product of the combined faiths of those who live
here..  Dark, alabaster, and every shade in between.  All beliefs are accepted
here, provided they are not discussed too often, lest blood should be spilt.
There are several bookshelves of varying religious works, an altar without
ornament, and numerous cots for clerics to take their rest in.

well-lit by magical rose and violet faerie fires for the reading of tomes.
There is a rug in guild colors of blue and violet which spans the stone floor,
and hammocks hang in rows along the walls, where the mages take their repose.
A series of bookshelves provide ample guild literature, and an oak coffee table
before a couch dominates the room.

However, you can create your own account by depositing some money.  If you want

bread and cool drink await those within who are willing to pay for the service,
and about the city, other willing merchants may also be found in abundance.
Eastwards the land stretches in unmarred wilderness to the far horizon, and to
the southeast you think you can catch glimpses of the thatched roofs of yet
another village, this one smaller and more humble.  A trail south along the
cobblestone wall seems to head in that direction.

under its green tendrils.  A stony path can be made out to the north, and the
wall makes its way southwards to a corner.

shortest races of beings.

   A four foot gray stone cliff, matted with clumps of green moss and overhung
with tall bending trees, is easily scaled by handy footholds in the rock.  The
place looks well-travelled by some hardy population of small-footed creatures.
One path continues in a north-south vein over the cliff, another breaks off and
leads east.

the bubbling ebbs of a tiny stream, pouring gently forth from a hole in the
rock on which you are poised, and flows southward.

   A quietly flowing stream drifts down a slim riverbed, leading south from a
small hole in the rock to the north.  The water is clear and pure, and seems
entirely empty of creatures..  It may be true this stream was taxed by heavy
fishing long ago that long since cleaned it of all life.

Tiny brown reeds on the banks lean downstream, sending the dragonflies airborne
from their stalks.  A wind whistles in the leaves of the trees above and no

downwards, where you awake with stars circling before your eyes.

   An old temple stairwell winds down in darkness into the inner, long
abandoned recesses of the golden temple.  It seems few have reason to travel
this way.  The dust that coats the steps lies mostly undisturbed, and an aura
of desertion hangs about the place.  Whoever does traverse these ancient halls
may or may not have the light of goodness in their motivations.

home.  Do you continue, or turn back?  Sometimes shadows may form a bluff of
great danger in the recesses of your imagination.
