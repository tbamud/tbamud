Temple of Sanctum~
   This large room appears to be inside a massive temple dedicated to the gods
of Sanctus.  The ceiling is supported by fluted columns and a main spiral
stairwell that leads both up and down.  Small rooms adjoin this chamber in all
four cardinal directions.  It is here mortals come to stay informed and discuss
their adventures.

The Temple of the Gods~
   This seems to be the highest point in the kingdom of Sanctus.  It is from
here that the worshipers of the gods come to pay tribute to those who have saved
them from the chaos and destruction beyond the sanctuary of the city walls.  
Large windows reach from the floor to the ceiling, giving an excellent view of
the city and countryside beyond.  An altar stands in the middle of the room with
a statue on each side.

   The altar is made from black granite and has been carved into a small basin
with a high back.  Almost as if it was meant to be some sort of seat.  
Inscriptions in some foreign tongue are written on every square inch of the
altar.  You wonder what they must say and who could have written it.

statue~
   As you examine the statues more closely you realize they must resemble the
two gods responsible for the creation and ongoing protection of Sanctus, Ferret
and Rumble.  They both radiate a strength and power that resembles the solid
white marble they were crafted from.

Inner Sanctum~
   This appears to be the highest room in the tower of Sanctum where only those
devoted to the guild of Clerics are allowed to practice their skills and spells
to become masters of their discipline.  The walls are covered in a white see-
through cloth giving one the impression of being inside of a tent rather than in
a room.  The room glows brightly, though one cannot tell from what source.

are resolved in this room by the High Council of Clerics.  They are responsible
for the health of all the citizens of Sanctus and are obligated to aid anyone who
is in need.  A large rectangular table with thirteen chairs surrounding it

Inner Void~
   This room is exempt from all normal laws of reality.  It appears to have
entered the realm of magic where the laws of science no longer exist.  The void
of this place is created within the traveler's mind and is the perfect place to
practice mystical arts.  For those who have trained hard enough they shall
receive assistance in their pursuit of knowledge and power.  Others will find
peace in this void and never be able to return.

Rean's Zone Description Room~
   Those who have achieved the power and fame to be considered a Magi rule the
Mages Quarter of Sanctus.  They are responsible for the upkeep of the magical
barrier that protects the city from the chaos of the outside world.  They may
also be called upon to protect the city in case of an attack.  The Magi are the
most reverred of all the classes as they are the most powerful.  But that power
has a price.  Only five Magi have survived.  Five decorative cushions are
placed in a circle in the middle of the room.

Above the Northern Gate~
   In between the Thieves and Warriors Quarter the Northern Gate is the main
defensive hold in case of an attack.  At this distance one can just barely make
out the shimmering dome that was created by the gods and is now sustained by the
Magi.  The dome curves along the walls of the city and can not be seen for more
than a few feet in any direction.  It flickers as if a mirage, only visible when
glanced at from one side.  Stone stairs lead down into the city wall.

city in case of an attack.  The room is a mess with maps piled high and

Thieves Retreat~
   All the curtains are pulled tight, the shades drawn low.  A feeling of
mystery and secrecy blankets the room.  Dim lights cause a dancing of shadows
that plays tricks on the eyes.  A few of the shadows may actually be people,
hidden easily in the darkness Those who have chosen the discipline of thievery
can learn invaluable skills here to further their training and wealth.

internal affairs of the city.  They control the trade and finances of the city.
Many disagree with this concept but none can disagree with the results.  
Thieves are masters when it comes to politics.

   This used to be a travelling room.  Entire sections of the floor are now

certainly a grim reminder to flee the second it seems a portal may be falling
apart.  The charred silhouette of what once must have been a man is blasted into
one of the walls.

Drakkar has achieved this mastery, but none have ever witnessed it.

   A few of the higher mages of Sanctus have been able to control the gateways
that have opened between realms.  One of these controlled portals is kept in
this room.  It is a one way ticket to the realm of Midgaard.  The portals are
still erratic and uncontrollable so anyone who uses them does so at their own
risk.  The flickering of the portal casts eerie shadows along the white walls.
This must be the only room in the temple that has an uneasy feeling about it.

the same bleak grey color.  It is here the Magi come to test their mystical
arts.  It is not a good place to get lost in.

required for the world to exist.  The Orb is the last balance left in the
realm.  If it were to be taken all hope would be lost.  Without it the city
would quickly be overrun by Drakkar and his followers.

Orb of Sanctum~
   It is here that the Orb has been placed to ensure its protection.  The
entire room is a made of black stone that seems to absorb all light.  A huge
pedestal sits in the center of the room surrounded by statues of every Magi to
ever live.  It is up to them to protect the Orb from any who wish to steal or
cause harm to it.

   A stark white room that is glaringly white.  A simple bed, desk, and chair

Kitchen~
   At first glance this room seems to be made just to prepare food for the

actually clerics and they are working over cauldrons of liquids that could not
possibly be food.  At least it does not smell like food.  This must be where
they make their healing elixirs, salves, and potions.

break or maybe just get away from home for a few days to receive one of the many
"treatments" available by the fine staff.  The sole proprietor goes by the name
of Orlok and has been known to be rough, even deadly, to any customers that
treat his "employees" unfairly.  The inn appears to be well kept.  Further to
the north one can see a winding staircase and a plethra of adjoining rooms.  It
seems the owners have temporarily closed due to renovations.

Sarge's Smithy~
   The Smithy used to be run by the Warriors Guild for protection of the city.
But when Sarge retired from his service in the guild they let him keep the
smithy that he created as a retirement gift.  Of course the fact that they had
no one that could replace him and do his quality of work was the real reason.
But, Sarge would never complain.  He has spent his life hammering metal into
weapons of mass destruction or armor of superior quality.  It is rumoured that
has never been given a task that he could not complete.

The Bunk Room~
   The sound of snoring comes from a few of the dozen or so racks crammed
together in this confined room.  The racks are stacked four high with only a
foot or two of space for someone to sit up.  The mattresses are only about an
inch thick and look very uncomfortable.

The Northwest Intersection~
   This junction lies at an intersection of Warriors Avenue and Warriors Alley.
The alley crosses the city east to west behind the homes of the local citizens.
The alley is very narrow and dark as the inner city wall follows it on the
southern side.  Warriors Avenue continues north and south.

Warriors Alley~
   This cramped alley leads past dark flickering shadows.  A few piles of
garbage are waiting to be cleaned up by the street sweeper.  An alley cat hisses
and then bolts as it senses some trespasser on its territory.  This alley does
not look safe and one might wonder whether or not they could encounter some
lurking thugs.

Warriors Alley~
   The inner city wall rises above to the south.  The sound of footsteps and the
rattling of armor can be heard from the guards patrolling the top of the wall.
The alley is even darker here and a person could easily hide in the shadows.

Warriors Alley~
   A line of houses block the way to the north.  They seem to have back doors
but all are bolted, locked, or nailed shut.  This is definitely not the most
friendly section of the city.  An alley cat bolts past as a large pile of
garbage almost collapses on it.

Warriors Alley~
   The alley is a little brighter here as it lies next to the Northern Road.  
The sound of creaking wagons and the pound of horse hooves on the dirt road
become trapped between the inner city wall and the houses within the alley
making strange echoing sounds that are very distracting.

The Northern Road~
   This road continues on with few other travelers visible.  The streets seem to
be surprisingly empty for some reason.  Shadowy alleys can be noticed to the
east and west along the inner city wall.  To the south is the Northern Gate to
the inner city.

Thieves Alley~
   The alley is cluttered with debris, maybe the street sweeper doesn't even
bother cleaning this place up.  The sound of a fight can be heard further to
the east within the alley.  This is definitely the most dangerous section of
Sanctus.

Thieves Alley~
   The sounds of someone fighting suddenly grow louder, then stop.  Seems like
that dispute was settled one way or the other.  The inner city wall to the
south keeps the alley eternally in shadows, no matter the time of day or night.
Houses to the north have their back doors shut and locked.

Thieves Alley~
   A pool of blood lies in the center of the alley, a trail of blood leads to a
garbage pile a few feet away.  A mangy mutt trots slowly past and starts licking
up the pool of blood.  A traveler here should keep moving unless they wanted to
draw attention to themselves.

Thieves Alley~
   The inner city wall to the south towers high into the air, blocking out most
of the light.  The wall looks to be made from stone blocks and some sort of
filler.  Its not possible to tell how thick it is, but judging from the height
one could guess at least half as wide as it is tall.

The Northeast Intersection~
   The Thieves Avenue comes to an intersection with a shady alley to the west.
This intersection is at the northeast corner of the inner city wall.  On top of
the wall one can see some type of post where the guards watch for any trouble.
A large building to the east must be some sort of warehouse.

Wagon Bay~
   Huge double doors have been built into the western wall of the warehouse.  
They are closed, barred, and locked with a padlock the size of your head.  No
one gets in or out without that key.  An aisle to load and unload wagons runs
to the east.

Wagon Bay~
   A path is opened up between the crates here for wagons to load and unload. 
The floor has turned to packed dirt and traces of horse manure leave an
unpleasant smell. Three wagons fill the center of the room. All look empty. 
A clump of mushrooms grows in the middle of the manure. They look ripe for
picking.

mushrooms~
   The mushrooms appear not to be poisonous and are relatively clean. They look
edible.

A Work Room~
   This building is cluttered together in no apparent order, wherever there is
room they simply use it.  This hallway has been converted into a small room for
the upkeep of armor and weapons.  A grindstone is in one corner.  In another
baskets of arrows are being sorted.  A recruit is polishing some armor and a
large sack of equipment looks like it is ready to be taken to the Smithy.

The Mess Hall~
   A dozen tables fill the room.  All bare except for a few people eating
before they go on their next watch.  The food does not look very appetizing,
but it serves it's purpose.  The army has had financial problems since it's
inception.

Warriors Avenue~
   In the distance one can hear some sergeant screaming at his recruits in a
booming voice that echoes off the buildings and walls around.  The clank of
armor and weapons is all about as guards change watches and work on their
equipment.
