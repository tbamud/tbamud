The Bridge~
   You have reached the Bridge, the central nervous system for Space Station
Alpha.  All around you are flashing screens a ndlights.  Status reports and
damage reports are scrolling o ffthe screen faster than you can read them.
The gravity is ve rylight in this room.  You can see blood staining the crash
couch of what was probably the Computer Systems Officer.  There are dozens of
egg pods here!

credits info~
   Hi, just a quick explanation of Space Station Alpha.
Esentially this area is a Sci-fi based area. A space station has been in orbit
around your planet and something has gone terribly wrong. Predator aliens and
introduced Alien aliens into the station to hunt along with the humans! The
station is completely infested and the crew of Space Station Alpha is doing
their best to hold out and clear the station. Too bad the captain has snapped
and more than half the crew has been killed or committed suicide.
Room #61 is a space shuttle that is the entrance to the station from the rest
of the world. Edit it to fit in yours.
Other than that it should be pretty much plug and play. It contains 1 deathtrap,
a room that has been sealed off that the players will definitely have to ignore
all the warnings to get killed in. It will serve them right if they are dumb
enough to walk into a sealed room that has a hull breach and no pressure!
This area is nasty. Not for people who are simply hack & slash. It will take
some thinking to clear. Best not to go alone too.
2 or 3 higher level characters should be able to clear it if they follow a
hit and run campaign. Since all but a few of the rooms are no magic spell
casters should map out which rooms magic will work in and cast protection spells
there or before they enter the station.  Magic works in the hangars and a few
other rooms. Best bet is to set up a base camp in the main hagar and clear the
immeadiate area of wandering aliens. Then heal up in the hangar and explore until
the next battle. Then drop back, heal up and head back out into it. Pick the
mobs off one at a time if possible. You really don't want to go into a combat
wounded. Plus fleeing here can get you killed too.
I recommend setting the zone reset bit so that it doesn't reload while
players are in the station. I don't think I have it set that way as the
default.
Anyway, enjoy.

Reactor Room~
   The main reactors that power the station are here.  There is a pannel on the
main reactor that looks as if a code has been partially entred.  Suddenly you
are surprized by Captain Marshal!  The man is obviously insane and screams "I
must destroy the station!  " as he aims his weapon at your head!

Predator Engine Room~
   Somehow you have managed to get all the way to the main engine room ofthe
Peredator's ship!  Too bad the technology here is so alien you can find nothing
of use.  Strange machinery hums and glows.  The same thick mist that covers
most of the ship is on the floor here too.
