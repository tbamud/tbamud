that dead ends to the north and continues on to the west.  To the south
the stones of the pyramid have been torn asunder by thieves, making
a low-ceilinged tunnel.

collapsed under the weight of the slowly settling stones of the
pyramid.  Now, a massive pile of rubble leads up into a hole high
in the northern portion of the hallway.  To the south, through the
rubble and fallen stones you see a sandstone crypt.

storm howls and bites at your face even here.
