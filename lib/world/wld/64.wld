A Mountain Trail~
   This trail leads up, up, up into the mountains.  You
hope you don't fall down, because that would hurt, hurt,
hurt!  The trail continues to the east, and you can go
back down to the small hidden valley to the west.

farther up into the mountains to the east, or go back

A Mountain Trail~
   Wispy clouds are beginning to surround you now, and
your ears pop due to the altitude.  To the east, you see
the summit of the mountain, and from the way the nearby
mountains are arranged behind it, you believe you're
on your way to a big valley.  You can also go down
to the west.

Near The Mountain's Peak~
   The peak of this mountain is another couple hundred
feet above you, but here is where the trail leads down
into the valley...  What an odd valley!
   The valley seems to have been filled up by a hundreds
of feet of lava many years ago.  It gives the valley an
odd, 'flat' look and darkish ground.  The path leads
down east into the valley, and west back to civilization.

The Trail To The Valley~
   The trail leads down into the valley, where, by judging
by the height of the trees, the lava had cooled tens
of decades ago.  Down below you see the path lead into
the small forest in the valley, and disappear out of
sight.  East leads into the valley, West back to civilization.

In The Valley~
   The ground has taken on the texture of dirt on the top,
but this valley is far too flat and too rocky to disguise
the catastrophe that happened here so long ago.  Looking
up to the mountains ringing this area, you notice several
mountains look as if they had 'exploded', which is strange,
considering that they are not volcanos.
   The path leads into the woods to the east, and back up
the mountain to the west.

In A Clearing~
   You come to a small clearing now, after walking for several
minutes through the silent woods.  An odd block sticks up
here and there in   the ground... wait a minute.  These
stones seem a little too regular, and from the circle
formation and size you could almost swear that they were...
crenellations?  Could some sort of building been buried
by the lava here?  A rusty ring sticks out of the earth
in the center... a trapdoor?  This is almost too good to
be true!
