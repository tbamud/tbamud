On A Small Ledge~
   You clamber out of the water up onto this narrow ledge to see if
it leads deeper into the mountain.  Unfortunately, the ledge is only
wide enough to rest upon for a while and there does not appear to be
any other exits other than rejoining the underground river.

River Ishtar~
   The river broadens even more here and the waters become murky.
The smell of saltwater has reached you from the east.  The Dragon
Sea cannot be far away.  To the east you can see the faint outline
of a city and to the north you see a large expanse of grass.

The River Delta~
   This is where the river empties out into the Dragon Sea.  The backrush
of water has kicked up a lot of sand and the blue sea is stained where
the river empties.  Looking west all you can see is water... all the way
to the horizon.  North of here is a small dock you think you should be
able to reach with out too much trouble.  The river stretches off to the
west back towards New Thalos.

On A Road~
   The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide.  One of these services is the construction crews
the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order.  Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

On A Road~
   You walk along a well used road with beautiful scenery.  To the north
tall pine trees form a wall that goes on for miles.  Between the road
and the trees lies a great expanse of grassy plains.  South of here,
beyond the river, lies the Great Eastern Desert.  The road continues
east and west.

   This is the man land route through the land.  Merchants can bring
their goods to the coastline and have them ferried onto ships for
export.  Travel by foot west will take you through New Thalos up and
over the Eastern Mountains and down into Midgaard.

Near The Shore~
   The road ends here turning into a small dirt path leading down the
beach and onto a dock.  To the north and south you see the coastline
stretching out before you.  West of here the lowlands roll up into
huge snow capped mountains.

On A Dock~
   You stand on a simple wooden dock that acts as an extension of the
road to the west.  The dock seems to have been here for quite a long
time but is still sturdy.  A small ladder has been built on the eastern
end to allow easy access to and from ships.

Under The dock~
   You are swiming underneath the dock.  You can see the four wooden
pylons that support the structure.  The murky water clouds you vision
as you gaze westward, but you think you can make out an iron grating
in that direction.
