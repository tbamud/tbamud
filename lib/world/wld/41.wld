The Tunnel~
   As you continue along this tunnel which heads deeper and deeper into
the earth, you notice that the tunnel must be a lot steeper than you
previously expected as there is a small rivulet of water gushing down
the one side of the tunnel.  The tunnel appears to extend straight to
the east for quite some distance.

The Long Tunnel~
   The tunnel seems to be slightly sloped here as it continues in its
east-west direction.  The tunnel walls are far apart, almost allowing
for four people to travel abreast with ease.  The walls do not seem to
be very damp, but there is a small rivulet running along the northern
wall of the tunnel.

The Long Tunnel~
   As you travel along this long tunnel, you begin to wonder just
how long it is.  The walls are fairly far apart, but you can see
that they begin to close in rather rapidly to the east.  In fact,
the manner in which they come together almost reminds you of a
funnel.

The Long Tunnel~
   You are standing in a long east-west tunnel.  It is not all that
wide at this point, perhaps wide enough for two people to stand side
by side without impeding each other.  Off to the west it appears that
the tunnel opens up some more while to the east it dives further down
into the earth, and you can see a small hole about two feet in diameter
about waist height in the southern wall.

The Long Tunnel~
   You find yourself in a small bulbous cavern ending.  The somewhat
circular 'room' is about thirty feet in diameter and you can see one
exit from it; a tunnel leading sharply upwards from the western wall.
The walls of this cavern are quite indistinct and you cannot see any
moss or dampness on them whatsoever.

The Golden Cave~
   You are standing in what appears to be the north-east corner of
this large cavern.  The cave is lit by the eerie, soft, golden light
which looks to be emanating from the walls themselves.  The cave
itself is enormous, extending quite a distance to the west and south.

The Hole~
   You find yourself standing in a small alcove as the tunnel comes to
a somewhat sudden end.  Looking about you suddenly notice a rather big
hole in the floor of the tunnel.  In fact, it seems that another step
forward and you would have fallen into it.
   The tunnel itself leads to the west, and looking down into the hole
in the floor reveals little beyond the fact that it seems to be very
deep and very dark.  There is a very strange smell emanating from the
hole, it almost smells like something down there is rotting.

reasons of sanity, you decide not to go this way.

The Tunnel~
   The walls of this small tunnel are almost completely covered in a
strange orange moss that flakes off to the touch.  The tunnel leads
in an east-west direction and the air within is very damp and very
stagnant.  There is no detectable breeze at all but a strange smell
emanates from the east.  There is a small, almost unnoticed hole in
the southern wall.

The Tunnel~
   The tunnel in which you currently stand is fairly wide (very wide
relative to almost all the other tunnels around here it seems) and
yet the air is quite damp.  The walls have a thin coating of moisture
upon them which looks and feels somewhat oiley.  The tunnel leads in
an east-west direction.

The Passage~
   This north-south passageway looks to be a natural creation, except
that the walls looks to have been roughly hewn in order to smooth them
a somewhat to make passage easier.  The walls still meander as the
passage makes its way deeper into the bowels of the earth.  A bizarre
shadow in the eastern wall leads you to suspect that a small passage
meets the tunnel there.

The Dark Passage~
   You find yourself in a small passage ending.  It is quite dark in here.
As you look about the damp walls, you notice that the passageway almost
appears to curve upwards towards the ceiling.  Looking up, you notice that
there is a small hole, just large enough to pass through.  Looking closely
at the curved part of the wall, it appears that someone (or something) has
carved small handholds into the wall to ease passage upwards.  The tunnel
itself leads off to the east.

hold you entranced.
   Looking about the cave, it appears to continue to the west and

lead somewhere.

The Passage~
   You stand in a fairly normal passage, slightly wider than is
necessary for one person, but not quite wide enough for two.  The
ceiling dips here rather surprisingly, or wait, is that because the
floor climbs upwards toward it?  The tunnel seems to narrow slightly
more as you look to the south, and widens up somewhat as you look
northward.  The light to the south continues to flicker.

exactly five feet wide and eleven feet tall.

to move carefully in order to not catch anything on the jutting rocks of
the ceiling and walls.  The diameter of the crawlway is about two feet,
and is a rather tight squeeze.  You'd better hope that there aren't any
worms or similar creatures down this way since it might be difficult to
defend yourself in here.
