Apartment 101~
   This room is a convenient space where the legal tenant can leave things to
have them protected against crashes and reboots.  If this is a vacant apartment,
do not leave your things here.  Only owned apartments are protected.

   Guests can also leave things.  If this is your apartment, typing 'house' with
the name of a player will add that player to your guest list if the player is
not on the list, or will remove the player from the guest list if the player is
already on the list.  The player specified must be in the player database for
the MUD, although he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the
time.

   Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on your

Building Foyer~
   This is a basic apartment-type foyer.  Mailboxes line one wall.  Another wall
has a bulletin board with various notes of interest for the tenants.  Hey,
there's a tenant meeting on Tuesday!  The elevator takes up the south wall.
There is a button beside the elevator and a display above it.
