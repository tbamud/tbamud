Stall~
   You're standing in a horses stall.  Hay is covering the floor, probably to
hide the smell thats coming from underneath it.  You can see the exit in the
distance to the east.

Field~
   You have stepped onto a small field.  It must be an old corn field thats no
longer in use.  The ground is very rough and full of small holes.  One might
fall if they don't watch their step!

Inside the Hole~
   As you crawl into the hole, darkness surrounds you.  You suddenly feel very
alone and lost, almost like a small child.  You look up and see a small beam of
light.  Can you even get back out of here?  Maybe you should try to "climb up"
out of the hole.

watch your step or else you might slip.

   A small log cabin stands before you.  A large cloud of smoke is pouring out
the chimney, filling your lungs with the scent of burning wood.  As you peek in
through one of the windows, you see a man inside sitting in a rocking chair.
He see's you and waves for you to come in.  He looks like a friendly enough
gentleman.  Perhaps you could get a bite to eat here.

through out the cave that you seem to be in the entrance of.  Surprisingly
enough, the cave is not dark.  It's slightly gloomy, due to some torches that
have blown out.  There is a thin puddle of spring water on the floor at your
feet.  You reach out and touch one of the walls.  A thin layer of water
cascades over your fingers.  The cave continues to the east.
