Rows of pews face forward giving their full attention to the pulpit
rising high above the ground.  The deep red carpeting underfoot shows
not a speck of wear or dirt.  It is obvious that New Thalonians take
religion seriously.

   You stand before a magnificantly crafted gate wrought in solid gold.
You gape in awe at the splendor of the spirilng towers beyond the portal.
The ruler of all the eastern lands resides in this fine palace, and he is
not a poor man.  The grand entrance lies byond the gate, and Sultan's Walk
is to the east.

The Northwest Tower~
   You stand on one of the four towers guarding the city.  The view from
here is great!  To the west you see the tall mountains that make up the
divide between here and Midgaard.  The River Ishtar slowly flows from that
direction.  South you can see the entire city of New Thalos and the Great
Eastern Desert to the south.

The chef is busy chopping up greens and other vegetables at the wooden
table for tonight's meal.  Servants scurry about grabbing utensils and
preparing fresh hares.
   A small door leads out into the hall northward and the doorway to the

trees, you see a delicate white gazebo.
   A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.

so the viewer may see an entire sculpture at a glance.
