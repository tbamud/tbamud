Rows of pews face forward giving their full attention to the pulpit

not a speck of wear or dirt.  It is obvious that New Thalonians take
religion seriously.

The Northwest Tower~
   You stand on one of the four towers guarding the city.  The view from
here is great!  To the west you see the tall mountains that make up the
divide between here and Midgaard.  The River Ishtar slowly flows from that
direction.  South you can see the entire city of New Thalos and the Great
Eastern Desert to the south.

The chef is busy chopping up greens and other vegetables at the wooden
table for tonight's meal.  Servants scurry about grabbing utensils and
preparing fresh hares.
   A small door leads out into the hall northward and the doorway to the

skins into.  The people are streaching the leather and cutting it into

trees, you see a delicate white gazebo.
   A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.
To your right stands a gold sign.

at each corner of the room and mirrors are placed in strategic locations
so the viewer may see an entire sculpture at a glance.
