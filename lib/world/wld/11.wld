Detta's [Frozen Castle] Description Room~
   @BTheme:@n The cliche fantasy castle with a curse. Am hoping to build a big
stone fortress that is all frozen in ice, complete with its occupants.
There will probably be a couple big specially-triggered mobs to defeat and some
wandering salespeople around the permiter selling the spoils from the castle.
There will be a couple secrets within the zone, and a tragic tale to uncover
if the player is so inclined ;).
   @GPlayers:@n Meant to be for players about level 15 to 20, with some of the
perimeter mobs being lower level, and ones deeper and higher within the castle
of higher level. Primarily an evil zone.
   @RLocation:@n The castle is set in the middle of a forest with a river running
through it.
Note that Indoor flags are deliberately set on outdoor rooms as the
zone has its own trigger-run weather messages.
   @MSecrets:@n None yet, but there will be ;). Will keep posted.
   @CNote:@n If you have any suggestions, spot any typos, bugs, or
weirdnesses, please mudmail me - Detta. :-) All input appreciated!
You can also email me at detta@@builderacademy.net
East takes you through the other zones I have built here.
Down takes you to the starting room of this zone.

A Luminous Path~
   Startlingly white compared to the rest of the dark surroundings, this shining
path flows like a glowing stream to a massive building of stone on the northern
horizon.  Southward it winds deeper into the silent grasp of the trees, its path
illuminating the forest gently like a ray of moonlight.

The White Drawbridge~
   This ancient drawbridge lies in the lowered position, covered with layers of
fluffy white snow that swirl restlessly about.  A cool wind bites at the air,
whipping against the stone blocks of the surrounding castle like an angry ghost,
beating with futility upon the unyielding fortress walls.

A Frozen Portcullis~
   A jagged toothy gate hangs suspended from the southern part of the ceiling,
frozen in place and coated with layers of smooth glassy ice.  Spikes hang
menacingly down, formed from the stalactites of slowly dripping water, every now
and again trembling slightly with the rumbling of thunder outside.

Hall of Legends~
   Colored murals adorn either side of this lengthy hall, their depictions
those of fierce battles and strong warriors standing victorious over fallen foe.
Amongst the faded illustrations are the likenesses of dragons as well as men,
fighting together against some common enemy.  Once undoubtedly bright and
glorious, the carefully crafted representations are now dull and worn, coated
with spidery-thin strands of frost and snow, everything glazed and foggy as if
part of some dream world.

games and glasses of drink lie sculpted in place, cocooned within the same icy
curse as the inhabitants themselves.

though lit with hundreds of tiny candles, each shimmering with a different hue

each dangling from delicate silver chains and shivering slightly every time the

ominous booms, flooding the lengthy hall with a variety of speckled colors.

western wall, long frosted over and wailing eerily with every movement of the
outside wind.  Within its recesses, clumps of coal sit never to be used, their
dark surfaces speckled with snow as if they were powdered chocolates.

snow shows no sign of melting.  Grim eyes watch over the place from ancient
tapestries that line either side of the hall, their icy glazed expressions
seeming every now and again to shift in the shadows.

although sturdy, are cracked and broken in several places.  Far in the distance,

   Long, snow-covered shelves run along the walls of this room, stacked with
piles of neatly folded clothing.  A few wooden mannequins stand half-dressed
here and there, frozen in place and ghost-like in the eerie abandoned cold.
Sequins and embroidered jewels glitter through the snow and ice as though the
last flickering embers of a slow dying fire.

herb linger subtly in the air, mixed with animal musks.  Hunter's trophies line
the walls, antlers reaching like icicle-covered trees from the periphery.  A
