In The Lower Branches Of A Large Oak~
   You are in a huge oak, about one third of the way to the top.  The branches
above you block out much of the light, but enough filters through for you to
see.  Small animals and birds scatter at your approach, rustling the leaves
all about you.  You could easily climb back down to the ground, or continue up
the tree.  One large branch juts outward to the west, possibly providing a
third choice of exit.

Out On A Limb In A Large Oak~
   This sturdy branch hangs far out over a path to the west, which you might
be able to jump down to.  Several squirrels scamper into hiding as you
approach, leaving you alone and swaying slightly with the wind.  To your north
you can see a small log cabin through the trees, and to the southeast there
seems to be some sort of clearing, with many birds circling above it.

Midway To The Top Of The Large Oak~
   You are in a huge oak, about midway to the top.  The branches above you
block out much of the light, but enough filters through for you to see.  A few
birds have remained to watch you from the fringe branches, well out of your
reach.  Scratches mar the tree here, and torn bark is scattered near you on the
branch.  It would seem some large forest cat lives nearby, so you had better be
careful!  You can continue a bit farther up the tree, or descend to limbs that
don't sway so much.

Above you the tree narrows farther, but it still looks like you could climb up

High In The Large Oak~
   The tree top gently sways in the wind, and you think you are as high as
you can safely go in the tree.  The limbs here show evidence of a small battle,
with ripped bark and loose feathers scattered everywhere.  Looking around, you
can see the forest stretching out below you in all directions.  To the east you
see Midgaard, and to the south the river runs through a deep chasm.  North and
west of here you can see another small village, and on the western horizon you
see a large mountain.

It emerges from a dark opening in the side of a mountain and flows through
Midgaard, and on into the forest.  It has eroded a deep chasm in the soft stone
under the forest floor, and is not visible for long after it enters the forest
proper.

E
mountain range northeast~
   A long mountain range stretches across the horizon to the north and
northeast.  You have heard rumors of many different sorts of creatures living
there, varying from Dwarves and Humans to Ogres and various humanoid creatures.
Some say that evil Dark Elves dwell in the underworld deep below the lands of
the Dwarves.  The caves of Moria also are found there, populated by all sorts of
evil creatures.

   Off to the southwest you can see a grass covered field, and a small lake;
nortwest of you is a small cabin and a large pile of wood.  Far to west the
treetops form a tight canopy, blocking out almost all sunlight and your view.
It is said that large wolves live there.  You've also heard rumors of horrible
spiders and drow living there.  You'd be best off leaving that area to more
experienced adventurers.
