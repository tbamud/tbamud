Entrance~
   A huge tower rises above you, the once massive portcullis has rusted
away.  You wonder how this tower still stands after all these years.  High
above in the tower a light flashes.  Do you dare enter?  Words are chiseled
into a tablet beside the entrance.

A Dark Hallway~
   The passage almost immediately starts to slope upwards, You see strange
drawings and symbols carved into the stone walls.  A sudden gust of wind
carries the smell of rotting flesh to you.

The stench grows worse the deeper you enter, maybe you should turn back
now.

curves to the east and south.  The walls made from mortar and stone crumble at
the touch and are covered in dust and grime.

   Whoever carved all these symbols must have had a lot of time on his hands.
The screams you heard earlier seem to intensify.  Upon closer examination those
symbols don't seem to be carved, but scratched or clawed into the stone.
Chunks of flesh and fingernails can be seen in the scratches, all oozing with
blood.

   More bodies litter the floors here.  Strange they seem to be stacked neatly
and inventoried.  The hall continues south and west.  You notice a small window
in the east wall that looks out into a clouded valley.

A Lighted Hallway~
   The spotless hallway continues both east and south.  A cold wind blows from
the south.  Strange how this hallway seems so clean compared to the rest of the
tower.  Maybe some life does exist within these walls.

A Lighted Hallway~
   The floor and walls are spotless.  A cold draft comes from the west or you
can go south.  The floor, walls, and ceilings are freshly cleaned.  Not a speck
of dust can be seen anywhere.  A pristine white glow is reflected on every
surface from an overhead lamp.

   The walls around you seem to absorb light and sound.  Bodies are stacked
neatly against both walls.  The hall continues north and south.  A small
collapse in one of the walls shows nothing but darkness on the other side.

A Lighted Hallway~
   The clean and bright hallway continues north and south.  A brisk breeze from
the south seems very refreshing and out of place.  Paintings along the wall
display a gathering, most likely a feast, within the tower centuries ago.

An entire section of the wall is missing and opens into a hidden inner wall of
the tower.  Their is neither a floor nor ceiling within, just a long drop to

several corpses in it off to one side.  A hallway is to the north.  The

dozens of possible unseen hideouts.  The hall continues south or east.
