Entrance to a Chasm~
   The rubble from the landslide to the west has thinned out, leaving a clear
path for you to walk down.  The granite walls of the chasm soar up above you,
showing you only a small swath of the sky.  To the east, you can smell the odor
of brimstone.  You fail to surpress a shudder when you remember the tales you
have heard of this place.

Deeper into the Chasm~
   The rubble from the landslide to the west has completely vanished, leaving a
rough surface of granite for you to walk upon.  Here and there, though, are
some deep furrows in the rock, always in groups of three.  You suddenly realize
that these cuts are claw marks, probably territory marks of some sort...  To
the east, the chasm gets yet deeper.

Deeper into the Chasm~
   The chasm walls soar up so high that you can see almost nothing of the sky.
The enterance to this hell-cursed chasm is to the west.  When you look to the
est, you realize that the end of this ordeal is in sight-you can see the
bottom.  The smell of sulfur is very strong here, and it seems to be wafting on
the air currents from the east.

The Bottom of the Chasm~
   You are at the bottom of an extremely deep granite chasm.  The only way you
can see even a small portion of the sky is by trying to look straight up.
There are multiple groups of three deep claw furrows all over the ground and
covering a good portion of the walls.  There is a cave in the north wall,
almost big enough for a large giant to walk into without ducking.

East side of the Chasm~
   To the west of here is the bottom of the chasm.  To the east, the path
continues rising, taking you away from the oppressive might of the towering
granite walls.  As it is, you can only see a small piece of the sky.  There are
numerous claw marks here, each several inches deep.  The smell of sulfur is
omnipresent, but it seems worse to the west.

Entrance to a Cave~
   The path up is supposed to continue to the north-east here, but the way is
blocked by a large mass of rubble.  There's no way you can get out that way.
To the east, however, is a large cave.  Maybe you can go spelunking.

A Cave~
   You are in a cave, not so large as caves go, but still, its pretty big
compared to you.  It doesn't go back too far, you can almost see all the way to
the back of it.  There is a small glow towards the back of the cave.  To the
west is the exit.

Entrance to a Cave~
   You have entered a large cave.  There are multiple stone spears coming from
the ceiling and the floor, giving you the unsettling impression that you are
walking into a giant mouth.  The thing that bothers you the most, though, is
that though the center of the chamber, there are stumps where other stalagmites
should be.  Something REALLY strong must have done that.

Further Into the Cave~
   You are going deeper and deeper into the cave.  The claw marks are back, and
they have reinforcements.  You see some claw marks that go five to six inches
into the stone!  The path through the stalagmites continues, and you feel too
captivated by curiosity to stop now.  You conviently forget that curiosity
killed the cat...

A Choice of Ways~
   You have reached the back of the cave.  It branches off in three directions
from here, with passages big enough to accomodate medium-sized giants.  To the
north is a smaller hole in the otherwise completely smooth walls.  The walls
are so smooth, in facts, that it is clear that they could not be natural...

Top of A Stairwell~

A Stairwell~
   You are plodding down a seemingly endless line of stairs.  They are all
featureless, made out of solid granite.  The only thing interesting about these
stairs is that they are very large and wide, big enough for a giant.  They
spiral downwards are far as you can see.  You look up.  They go just as far
that way.

Bottom of a Stairwell~
   You are at the bottom of a very large stairwell.  The steps themselves are
barely small enough for you to go up the stairs without climbing up each step.
The stairwell is large enough to hold a giant, with some room to spare.  To the
east, you detect a faint humidness.

   You are in a large corridor.  There is moisture coating the walls, and some
other unidentifiable substances on the floor.  Like the rest of this place, the
ceiling is high above, almost lost in shadow.  To the west, you see a
stairwell.  To the east, you see more corridor.

There are numerous brooms and mops around, as well as a few buckets and a well
carved into one corner.  Evidently this is a storeroom for cleaning supplies.

rock.  To the south, you see an intersection, and to the north, you see more
hallway.  You notice that the smell of sulfur and brimstone has intensified...

there would be a watchful dragon nearby.  You think you hear a few high-pitched

A Guard Chamber~
   You are looking at what is quite obviously a guard room, and you can also
tell that this area is very well traveled, and from some of the deep grooves in
the rock you guess that many dragons have waited in this room for permission
beyond.  You also notice that there is some smoke drifting down the ramp to the
west.

A Ramp~
   You are walking up a ramp that is, if anything, more impressive then the
species that made it.  There are inlaid designs along every inch of the walls,
made out of gold, silver, platinum, and countless diamonds and rubies.  The
granite floor has somehow been made so that the rock has the illusion of being a
carpet.  The smell of sulfur, which is intensifying, is the only aspect of the
stairwell that you think could be better.

all of the treasure with you.

gold inlaid design, with many, many gems studded into it in an artistic
fashion.  You think you can see a seam around the edges of the circle, and
there is a small slot in the exact middle of the pattern.  To the west, you see
a ramp desending downward, and you see three passages in the north, east, and
south walls of the room.  The stench of sulfur is so thick that you can almost
see it, and it is making your eyes water.

the wall, still carrying his sword and shield.  You shiver.  What a horrible

wall, a large circular hollow, with several indentations as if for places to
lean your elbows, but they are way too big for you.  Everywhere you can see
large designs, showing knights on horseback being slaughtered, countrysides
being ravaged, and castles being destroyed.  They are obviously a monument to
some particularly evil acts by dragons.

them.  You start to get an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach...
