Main Engineering~
   The gentle murmur of the engine rumbles perpetually throughout these rooms.
Various colored lights flash and blink on their respective panels, keeping track
of things like the warp core temperature, current speed and the ship's shield
specifications.  The room is longer than it is wide, and it has fairly low
ceilings.  Computer terminals cover all the walls, and a large table built into
the floor sits in the middle of the room.  Located at the far end of the room is
the warp core, a large pulsating vertical tube.

     I created this zone because I'm a fan of the show Star Trek: The Next
     Generation. This zone features all of the main characters from the
     show, and many of the items too. This zone features about 45 rooms,
     and is good for players of level 26-30. Everyone except for the
     ensigns, Picard, and Data are rougly a bit stronger than Jupiter. Data
     and Picard are much harder, and the ensigns are easier. I have a spot
     for a holodeck, but I haven't added anything in yet.

     Written entirely from scratch in WordPad. Feel free to edit, modify,
     and do what you want with this zone!

Geordi's Quarters~
   The most immediately noticable quirk of this chamber is the sparseness of its
decorations.  Considering the fact that the owner is blind, it isn't at all
strange to find that the room is almost completely bare, just the basics.  A
small personal computer sits on a desk against the western wall, in between two
windows that look out into space, not that it really matters.  A neatly made bed
has been placed against the northern wall.

Data's Quarters~
   This room is fashioned in such a way that one would be almost unable to tell
that it was designed by an android.  Some easels and paintings have been
positioned along and on the northern wall, displaying Data's person expression
of what he sees, which is mainly spacial phenomenon.  A huge computer screen
showing a cross section of the Enterprise dominates the view to the south.
In front of said screen is a large desk which boasts a wide array of computer
controls.  What is quite perplexing is the lack of any sleeping facilities.
Data apparently, does not need to sleep the same way we do.

   This area is very poorly lit.  The brig is where all of the criminals and
prisoners are kept while onboard the Enterprise.  Three fairly large cells can
been seen in the southern part of the room, defended with invisible laser bars.
A computer control panel is situated in the northwestern corner of the room,
which is where the force fields for the cells are controlled.

   The room is very neat and tidy, with a couch and several chairs arranged
around a coffee table by the eastern wall.  A small partition at the northern
part of the room separates his sleeping area with the rest of the room.  Riker

   Here is the clinically clean sick bay.  About a dozen beds are arranged along

scattered around the room.  A large glass window in the northern part of the
room separates the doctor's office with the rest of the room.  Desite the
seemingly random presentation of some of the equipment, Dr.  Crusher keeps

   A long corridor reaches for quite some distance to the north and south,
managing to look almost exactly like every other corridor on this ship.  The
sick bay can be located to the west, and looking in an easterly direction can be
seen the fourth holodeck.  These passages aren't very wide, and the light beige
walls have been rounded, making the corridor an oval shape.  You see the
holodeck's control panel beside the holodeck door, and it has some information
on it.

Holodeck 4 Entrance - A Narrow Alley~
   You emerge into a dark narrow alley. Tall dark brick buildings block your
way north and south. You can see that the windows on the buildings are fairly
high, and some have been boarded up. The smell from the rotting food and
garbage mixing with the foul water on the ground is unbearable. You can hear
the sounds of a bustling marketpace to the east. The archway leading out of
the holodeck is west.

Enterprise Security~
   Like the brig, for a seeminly un-related reason, the heart of the
Enterprise's security is a dimly lit room.  But, very much unlike anywhere else
onboard, the whole chamber is surounded by weaponry lockers, except the northern
wall.  A large glass window protects dozens of different phasers, blaster rifles
and other high-tech devices of war.  Three long tables surrounded by chairs
stretch across the room.  A top-privilege replicator stands to one side, only
the memebers of security may use it.

tables are scattered around the room, surrounded by metal chairs.  A long bar
spans almost the entire length of the southern part of the room, and about two
dozen bar stools are sitting in front of it.  It's very noisy in here, due to

Cargo Bay 2~
   You're in the cargo bay 2 of the Enterprise.  It's quite a large room, with a
very high ceiling and a lot of floor space.  Several hundred plastic crates and
barrels with the Starfleet insignia on them stacked right up to the ceiling.

   A small screen above the door reads "Deck Three".  The turbolift walls have
been rounded off, making it in the shape of a tube.  Several vertical rows of
lights make this place very well lit.  From here, you can access the other decks
on the Enterprise.  There is a small instructional panel by the door.

Picard's Ready Room~
   In Captain Picard's ready room, a long couch has been placed beside the door,
while a large U shaped desk is located by the northern wall.  A small computer
screen is sitting on the desk, as well as several other papers and documents.
A single high window beside the desk looks into space, and a fish tank is
located in the northwestern corner of the room.  This is where the Captain makes
all of his important decisions.

Main Bridge - Upper Half~
   You find yourself on the upper half of the main bridge of the USS
Enterprise. Directly in front of you is a thick railing that contains many
different computer panels used for the tactical systems of the ship. The
entire southern wall is covered with computer consoles, where the ship's
main systems are controlled. Two small curved ramps on either side of the
room lead north to the lower part of the bridge, and a large circular
skylight shows the space outside the ship.

Conference Room~
   A large glass rectangular table sits in the middle of the room, surrounded by
about a dozen comfortable looking office chairs, one for each member of the
senior staff.  The entire eastern wall is covered with windows, looking out into
space.  Because of the vast expanse of space which is viewed eastern wall, this
room appears to be very dark, which is a good atmosphere for discussing the many
important issues that are the everyday of the crew.

   You find yourself on the lower half of the main bridge of the USS
Enterprise. An enormous view screen covers almost the entire northern wall,
and is currently displaying a view of the stars rushing by. Three large
chairs in the northern part of the room, in front of the railing, face the
screen. This is where the Captain, Commander Riker, and Counselor Troi sit.
Two computer consoles with built in chairs rest about ten feet in front of
the chairs, also facing the view screen. This is where the ship's pilot and
information officer sit.

Outer Space by the Enterprise~
   You are floating in outerspace, right beside the USS Enterprise.  Billions of
stars glitter and sparkle from every direction, originating from the vast
expanses of deep space.  Without a spacesuit, one would surely perish out here.
A large gray door leads into the Enterprise's Shuttle Bay.

Transporter Beam~
   This section of the transportation deck is where the actual teleportation
occurs.  The chamber is perfectly round and quite tall, to house the round pads
on the floor.  Everything is the most brilliant of white, excepting the blinking
red lights on the floor and the blue ones on the ceiling.  When activated, the
whole area flashes the same color as the walls, which only server to intensify
the bright beams.

Alien World~
   This part of the alien world appears to be a clearing in the middle of a
mutated forest.  What go for trees here are tall, circular pyramid type
structures with three or four basin-like layers.  The grass is purple, the sky
is a deep crimson and the clouds are a hideous yellow.  A small watch-tower
stands just to the north, fallen into disrepair.

A Private Detective's Office~
   The wall is papered in a plain brown to match the shade of the polished
wooden floor.  A large window is partially blinded to the south, and has a view
of the streets below.  A hat-stand is positioned to the side of the door to the
north, which has a small frosted-glass panel with an advertisement on the
outside.  A large cluttered desk lies underneath the window facing the door with
the chair quite some distance away, looking like it's used to lean back quite
frequently.  A quaint little clock hangs on the wall.

A Genetic Scientific Laboratory~
   Everything is white or silver and kept perfectly clean.  Many chemicals are
layed out in a specific order all around the room on laboratory tables.  There
is a large dentist-like chair in the center of the room.  It's slightly longer
and is suited more for being left in a horizontal configuration.  There are
loops of metal encircling it, each with complex computer circuits and scanning
equipment.  To the east are four large, circular booths, about the size of a
shower.  Three of them contain what appear to be half-human beings, the fourth
is empty.
