   This is the poor part of Elcardo.  Small dirty poor children run past you
screaming their heads off.  Poor men sit all over the roads begging for money
it really is a sin.  It is very strange, the rest of the city is well off money
wise but as soon as you get here it is very poor.

   The normal citizens aren't allowed in this part of the town unless they are
leaving.  The gate is only available in the day time because it is always
locked up for the night.  Two large Elcardo Knights stand here guarding the
gate with their lives.  You can hear children playing from up the road.  The
gate is made out of steel.  It looks almost impossible to break in to the city.

The Guard Room~
   Blood and guts are all over the floor and walls in this room.  It looks as
though a few prisoners escaped and came after the guards.  It is even more
gross that part of the guts have been eaten.  They must not feed the prisoners
very well.

A Path between Hannah and Elcardo~
   Forests surround you, but to the east you can just make out the city of
Elcardo.  While to the west and north some you have heard lies the city of
Hannah.  The path looks relatively empty, and unused here.

A Path between Hannah and Elcardo~
   This well travelled path links the cities of Elcardo and Hannah.  The two
cities were once strong allies until the City of Hannah started having problems
with strange creatures storming the city walls.  All communication between the
cities has been cut off for some time now.

Before the City of Hannah~
   Just to the north can be seen a pair of barred and rusted gates, the gates
have been closed for a long time and rumors of the city within being destroyed
or deserted abound.  The city walls stretching to the east and west are crumbled
in some places, even torn down.
