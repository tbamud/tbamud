elf chief elven guard~
the chief of the elven guard~
A lazy-looking Elf lies on his bed snoring loudly.

   This elf looks somehow more experienced than any guard in the village guard.
By the look of the uniform he is probably the chief of the village guard.  You
notice some scars on the hands and one on the neck of the elf.  He has
obviously been in battle in his days.
