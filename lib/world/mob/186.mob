the newbie monster~
The newbie monster stands here looking confused.  Kill him!  Kill him!
~
   What an odd looking little beast.  He looks harmless, but you never can tell.
He is only about 4 feet tall, but he pretty muscular looking...  Maybe you
should ask if he needs help?  Nah...  Kill him.

pet dragon baby newbie~
the baby dragon~
Someone's little pet dragon has gotten loose, and is sniffing about here.
~
   Awwww...  How cute!  A little baby dragon.  He's about 3 feet long and you
just want to cuddle him to death...  No, you really want to kill him to tell the
truth.  But, remember, even a little dragon can be a big problem.

keeper guard monster newbie~
the Newbie Guard~
The Newbie Guard is here wondering where that dragon went.
~
   The Guard also had the job of taking care of the Alchemist's pet dragon, but
he doesn't seem to be doing a good job of it.  He looks at you and says, 'Have
you seen that dragon?  Master will have my head if I don't find him.  '

the quasit~
A funny little imp-like thing (a quasit perhaps?) is sneaking about here.
~
   Little green, vaguely humanoid shaped creature, with a long pointed tail.
It is hard to say because before you ever get a good look at it, it darts back
into the shadows.

minotaur~
the massive Minotaur~
The Great Minotaur is wondering just what you'll taste like.
~
   A massive man, with the head of a bull.  He looks as strong as bull too, but
not nearly as smart.  Actually, now that you consider it...  He looks a heck of
a lot meaner than any bull you have ever seen...  And he is coming this way!
