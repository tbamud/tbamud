the Elven Wizard~
An Elven Wizard is here, creating fireworks for the festivities.
~
   The Elven Wizard looks at you in a solemn sort of way.  His gaze seems to
penetrate through your innermost being.  He is wearing a silvery cloak and
holding a multi-colored staff.  Although he appears to be older than the oldest
man, he seems to have an inner strength which most mortals cannot overcome.

the Keeper of the Ring~
The Keeper of the Ring is here, guarding his treasure jealously.
~
   The Ring Keeper is a rather big but short halfling.  His short stature and
bulbous nose belie his true nature.  An elven sword that glows with a blue light
hangs from his belt, and on his finger you see the One Ring.  Although usually a
halfling of peace, he will fight you to the death if you attempt to take away
that which belongs to him.
