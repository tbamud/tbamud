   Peaceful and content, this dove sways slightly as it sings a soft, trilling

scents of the nearby blossoms.

the alchemist's shade~
The shade of the alchemist, Ghendry, glares at nothing in particular.
~
   Clearly long dead, the shade is merely a wisp of something physical, barely
discernible among the shadows.  In life, it was a man of great stature in
society and much loved by the people of the realm.  Now, however, the shade
seems more a forgotten past than legend made to live again.

the ghost of the great halfling hero, Fennywen.  A bit translucent and
thoroughly dead, the ghost is having some time adjusting to its new
circumstances.
