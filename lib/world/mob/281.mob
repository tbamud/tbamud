woman female pretty~
the female~
A pretty female sits on the edge of a table, talking with someone.
~
   She is dressed in some loose clothes and wears a short, dark cloak.  Brown
curly hair lines her face which looks very pleasant, as if smile and joy used
to house it.  Judging by that short sword on her side, she is something else
than just a normal housewife.

the hooded wanderer~
You barely notice a hooded man, sitting at the corner.
~
   As you star he turns away.  But you were quick enough to notice a tattooed
symbol on his wrist - like a small, reddish eye.

dwarf taciturn silent~
the dwarf~
A taciturn dwarf is standing here, fingering his great beard.
~
   His great beard is reddish and it has been plaited carefully.  Even as a
dwarf he looks very robust, and a huge rucksack and a bunch of utilities, such
as hammers and dark chisels, seem to be carried as though they weighted
nothing.

A pale man is lying on the bed, moaning faintly.

brownie man bearded~
the brownie~
A short, long-bearded man is standing here.
~
   What a jolly being.  His face is reddish and he looks very kind.  The
clothes he wears are of cheerfully woven and brown leather, some of them simply
patterned.  As he were ascertaining something, he utters odd words and beckons
his companier.

the brownie~
You barely see a short man with a greenish beard.
~
   He seems to have some peculiar abilities.  Perhaps these brownies are not as
harmless as they look like.

gwytehydra hydra beast green~
the gwytehydra~
A greenish creature with many tentacles rises from the pond!
~
   These strange monsters are slimy and their skin is covered in the shaking
rings of meat and vesicles.  They have several ugly heads with an eye standing
in the each.  The land of Gwyte is where they come from.  It is rumored that
they serve the Evil and therefore were sent around as messengers of horror.

Galeaufir~
A tall hunter stands here, glancing over the edge of the forest.
~
   Galeaufir looks like a man who is always sure of himself and his doings.

today's hunt does not seem a success at all.

hobgoblin brownie~
the hobgoblin~
A hobgoblin stands here, grinning at you broadly.
~
   The hobgoblin resembles much of those brownies you encountered before,
although being a bit shorter.  But somehow you feel their personality might be
entirely unlike, and include sides which are dark and strange.

centaur~
the centaur~
A beautiful centaur rests on the dais.
~
   She is tall and well-proportioned.  The dark hair descends on the light
brown skin, making no curls.  Her big eyes radiate wisdom and pleasant heat,
making it difficult to leave this fabulous being.  No doubt she enjoys high
esteem amidst the small folk of this forest.

An impressive brownie sits here, talking with the centaur.
~
   Taller than others, this brownie looks very authoritative.  His beard is as
white as snow and almost reaches his feet.  The jacket he uses is decorative,
and his hat is high and very fine in its own manner.
