the black cat~
A black cat roams about suspiciously.
~
   No animal has been more revered or feared in history, and no animal has been
more closely associated with Halloween than the black cat.  The witch's best
friend and helper ...  A reincarnated evil spirit ...  The harbinger of bad
luck.  Countless tales recall the mystical qualities of black cats from King
Charles I of England, who was so obsessed with the fear of losing his black cat
that he had it guarded 24-seven, to fishermen's wives keeping a black cat at
home to prevent sea-going disasters.  In Australia and Britain black cats are
considered lucky, while in America we basically believe the opposite.

groundhog hog~
the groundhog~
A small brown furry groundhog sticks its head out of the ground.
~
   Groundhog Day, a Canadian and American tradition, the day (February 2) that the
groundhog, or woodchuck, comes out of his hole after winter hibernation to look for his
shadow; foretells six more weeks of bad weather if he sees it; spring is coming if he cannot
see his shadow because of clouds; supposedly goes back into his hole if more bad weather is
coming and stays above ground if spring is near; statistical evidence does not support this
tradition.
   This tradition is from a old European belief that if it is sunny on Candlemas Day, then
the winter would remain another six weeks. Candlemas Day was celebrated on February second
and commemorated the purification of the Virgin Mary. Candles for sacred uses were blessed
on this day.

Six more weeks of winter for 2003!
