chimerae guardian~
a chimerae~
All three sets of a chimerae's eyes glare straight at you.
~
   It stands still as a statue, its stance rigid and unmoving.  It has the
hindquarters of a goat, the forequarters of a strong lion and the wings of a
black dragon.  It is enormously and evilly impressive.

dragon blue~
a blue dragon~
A blue dragon turns its malevolent eyes upon you.

wily enough to get past the guardian.
