the Elcardorian priest~
An Elcardorian orthodox priest stands here with a stern look on his face.

   At first sight, he's not the kind of priest you want to leave your children
with.  Than again, with the aura of calmness oozing out of him.  Maybe taking a
rest next to him would not be such a big risk.

The Suncas prison guard is here making sure that no one leaves the dungeons.

   He looks tired and inept.  The monotony of his job has caused him to become
bored and lax.  Of course so few of the prisoners stay long enough down here to
even attempt to escape so a guard is more for looks than need.

A dark hooded man roams the streets
~
   You can see almost nothing about this man because his black cloak covers him
fully.  Just between the opening of the coat, a glint of steel catches your
eyes.  Odds are this man would like to be left alone.  He is almost certainly a
rebel which is apparent by the symbol on the head hilt of the dagger.  Who is he
stalking?
