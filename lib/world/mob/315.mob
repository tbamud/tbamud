teleport operator man~
the teleport operator~
A man in a Mage's Guild robe awaits to teleport you to your desired locale.
~
   His manner and bearing are both that of a perfect gentleman and
professional.  It seems the Mage's Guild in this town must have a hard time
making the rent payment, so they rely heavily on the business from this shop to
support most of their payment.
