plain don't care.  They see enough of his kind since the tavern was built.

with the muscles he had acquired, as he has worked for long years as the armorer
of Haven.  He impatiently taps his fingers on the counter as he waits for you to
tell him what you wish of him.

possessive of it.  The cartman is a big, muscular man who looks as if he knows
the use of his weapon.  His muscles ripple as he casually tosses heavy chairs
and such from one side of his cart to the other.  From his dress he looks like a
sailor, as do most of the people in Haven.

She gets well-fed, well-paid, and she hardly has to do anything now that
Degruziel has a favorite, and it isn't her.  She thinks she has it made, and it
