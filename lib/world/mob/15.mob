allah god yahweh~
Allah~
You resist the urge to avert your eyes from the sight of the one true God.
~
   The sight is for each man a different, a mirror into the true nature of each
person's body and soul.  At first a proud, bitter old man, but just as easily a
gentle extended hand, a smile, and gardens...  Gardens.

Michael~
The archangel Michael turns and begins to look you over.
~
   At first you see nothing but a bright and comforting glow; then the image
sharpens suddenly, and you see a face, eyes, hands, but then that too fades, and
you see nothing.

raphael angel archangel~
Raphael~
The archangel Raphael looks up and frowns at you in disapproval.
~
   It is impossible to get a solid glance at the archangel.  He is nothing that
is human, and with a mere whisper, he dispels every image that you attempt to
create in your mind.

The cherubin of the blazing sword looks at you and begins to chuckle.
~
   The monster before you seems to be nothing more than a baby or young child,
wrapped in a glowing white cloth, but as you try to walk past, the beast grins
and cackles, drawing its sword and blocking the way.

the jester~
A mad, drunken jester is sitting here, lost in his deepening stupor.
~
   He is dimly aware of your gaze.  Chuckling softly, you hear him mutter
something obscure: dragons, the temple, the falling of great empires.  He laughs
at you and takes another drink.

One of the jinn dances in and out of the air before your eyes, taunting you.

   You have heard legends of these creatures, the mischievous little demons said
to be trapped in lamps and bottles, capable of granting all kinds of powerful
wishes.  To you, it looks like nothing more than an annoying little sprite.

the slumped old man~
A slumped, shaking old man stands up and begins to yell at the world.
~
   He wears a faded uniform, decorated with honors of his own creation,
slackened jaws and pasty white bags sagging under his ugly, hating eyes.  A tuft
of reckless dark hair scatters across his forehead, and his right hand shakes
and shakes.

al-Hakim~
The mad Caliph al-Hakim is here, dissecting a young boy.
~
   The darkest skin, and eyes so white.  Covered only in a shoddy woolen tunic,
he has not bathed in months nor eaten in days, and yet his smile, so charming.

must.  "

Uthman~
The third of the rightly-guided Caliphs, Uthman, stands before you.
~
   He was chosen as leader by a clique of jealous rivals who could agree upon no
other.  The memory of the Prophet fading quickly from the minds of the faithful,
he could do little, and was in the end killed by his enemies.

Ali~
You have come before Ali, fourth and last of the Rashidun.
~
   Some view him as the closest to God among all of the Caliphs, the one most
deserving of our respect and reverence.  Still others saw him as a schismatic, a
heretic, one to be killed and forgotten.  To look at him now is for you to
decide for yourself.

would not prostrate himself before the first human beings.  And then he gestures
at you, smiling, and conjures an image of all the temptations that will be yours
if you in turn but follow him.
