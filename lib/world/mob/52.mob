mimic boulder skeleton skeletons~
the mimic~
Two skeletons lie crushed under a large boulder.

   This large boulder seems to have been dropped here at some point, since there
aren't any boulders native to this area.  The two skeletons beneath it are
simply that, bones...  No rags or anything else appears to be attached to them.
