A putrid zombie is here.
~
   It is a prime example of the undead: sickly green skin, sunken eyes with a
yellowish tinge, and sharp, dirt-encrusted claws.

A poisonous asp slithers here.

morticia guildhead~
Morticia~
Morticia, Guildhead of the Living Dead, is here.
~
   Her long, raven black hair drapes those stunning curves of hers.  How did
such a sweet thing become the leader of this cult?  As a bard once wrote, 'You
could tell she was practiced at the art of deception by her bloodstained hands.

Lazarus~
Lazarus, Assassin and Guild Physician, is here.
~
   This master herbalist was found too valuable to the Guild as a maker of both
soothing balms and poisons.  Even death could not release him...  The
necromancers just reanimated him.

beetle undead~
the undead riding beetle~
An undead riding beetle is parked here.
~
   A fine example of Necromancy, this giant beast can travel for miles with no

wraith knight~
the wraith knight~
A wraith knight stands a silent watch here.
~
   This was probably some poor adventurer, like you, before the Necromancers
got their hold on him.  Now he just awaits, blade drawn, like some ethereal
beefeater.

the Crypt Keeper~
The Crypt Keeper, grinning at you maliciously, is here.
~
   The dessicated little fellow cackles with mad glee as he approaches you.
He twitches from excitement so much that his scraggly hair jostles as he
flashes his dull yellow teeth.

hermit~
the hermit~
A Hermit, starved for company, is here.
~
   Although raving mad, the hermit has come out of his isolation since he has
not spoken with anyone for ages.  The shaggy hermit draws you over and begins
to tell a strange tale, 'Some 600 years ago, when I was but a lad, a great
dragon ruled the land.  His name was Ancalador.  Many heroes came to do battle
with him, but all failed and died, horribly, I imagine.  But one wizard
challenged the Drake to a magic duel.  He too died, like the others, but with
his last breath, the wizard turned the mighty Ancalador to stone!  Many
believed the dragon's evil reign ended, but after the dancing and drinking were
over, and life returned to its quiet pace, the people began to notice that the
Dragon's presence could still be felt.  Ancalador did, in fact, continue to
rule from his petrified prison through the manipulation of the minds of men.
Indeed, he has done so to this day.  Many believe he is plotting the day he can
return in the flesh, so to speak...  ' With that the Hermit begins to cackle
madly, ~
