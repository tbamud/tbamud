the Madman~
A madman has tea with his mortally challenged friends.
~
   He looks up at you with misted eyes and clenches his knife convulsively.
Spluttering and shaking, he begins to rise to his feet, cradling the cold steel
of his knife in his hands.  A tiny voice in your head says very clearly,
'Uh-oh.  ' You feel chilled...  Distant.

Butcher~
the Butcher~
The butcher glances at you briefly and SLAMS down his cleaver.

   His apron is covered with bloodstains, as are his large, thick python-arms.
He holds a cleaver loosely and easily, almost as if he were born gripping that
thing.  His hair seems greasy and useless on his balding pate.  He sneers at
you and motions for you to take a number.
