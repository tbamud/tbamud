a young girl~
A young girl sits cross-legged on the floor, her eyes closed as though asleep.
~
   This girl's age is impossible to tell, sometimes it seems as though she is a
small child and then the light shifts and she seems a woman.  The only thing
remaining constant is her peaceful expression and her eyes, which remain
serenely closed as though she is deep in some dream state.

A slightly eccentric looking shopwoman watches over her collection.

   A vaguely wild look sparks in her eyes as she bustles about the shop, frizzy
hair poking out from a tightly woven braid and fresh smears of dust and dirt
streaking her face.  Her expression is focused and intense, piercingly aware of
all around her.

   This young girl looks to be between three and five years old.  Her bright
blue eyes are slightly vacant as though she is far away in some imaginary place,
and her lips move silently as though she is singing or whispering to herself.
A colored crayon moves back and forth as she draws around her splayed fingers,
leaving the white canvas of paper covered with the smeared dark outlines of
hands.

A little shadow-baby kicks restlessly within its cot.
~
   This little baby smiles brightly as it coos and gurgles to itself.  Little
shadowy limbs flail and kick randomly as its tiny muscles strengthen themselves
slowly.  It is impossible to tell by its little porcelain face whether it is
male or female, but its little navy jumpsuit is distinctly boyish.  The only
thing unusual is its ghostly transparency, fading in and out of visibility like
a flickering shadow.

been carefully made up, eyes sparkling as she prepares food for the family.

all of his face but his two squinting blue eyes.  Large in build, and slightly
overweight, his expression is vacant and far away.  Completely absorbed in his
somewhat unsuccessful music playing, the only thing remarkable about him is the
fact that his hand is mauled and deformed, only three fingers grasping the
trumpet where there should be five.

and the next transparent and fading, a shadow-gray hue darkening her features.

A shadow-girl huddles in the corner.
~
   Looking to be about fourteen, this shadow girl is sitting tightly in the
corner with her knees pulled up to her chest and her head hidden in her arms.
She looks so still as to almost be mistaken for a doll if it weren't for the
heaving of her shoulders with slow breaths and the occasional fidget.

A concerned looking shadow-boy sits quietly watching.
~
   In his early teens, this young lad sits quietly, his face furrowed as if in
deep thought and his large blue eyes look slightly puzzled.  A smattering of
freckles darkens his face, thick eyebrows and a tangle of dark hair flickering
slightly in the stirring air.

   Roughly ten years old, this young boy has an open smiling face, his large
grin full of gaps where his adult teeth are still growing in.  Scruffy blonde
hair swirls itself carelessly around his head, sticking up haphazardly as if he
had just crawled out of bed.

of her face as she plays.

A tiny shadow-toddler wanders about, looking for food.
~
   Barely out of baby years, this little girl wanders around the room with a
blank expression on her face.  Careless wisps of blonde hair stick up all around
her head, and her face is dirty and smudged where she has been eating whatever
she can find.
