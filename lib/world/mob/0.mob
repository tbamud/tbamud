Jack Russell~
Jack Russell hunts with his dogs.
~
   The Jack Russell takes its name from the Reverend John Russell who bred one
of the finest strains of terriers for working fox in Devonshire, England in the
mid-to-late 1800's.  Rev.  Russell (1795-1883), apart from his church
activities, had a passion for fox hunting and the breeding of fox hunting dogs
he is also said to be a rather flamboyant character, probably accounting for his
strain of terrier's notability and the name of our terrier today.

John Russell~
John Russell seems to have lost his dog.
~
   John Russell maintained his strain of fox terriers bred strictly for working,
and the terrier we know of today as the Jack Russell is much the same as the
pre-1900's fox terrier.  The Jack Russell has survived the changes that have
occurred in the modern-day Fox Terrier because it has been preserved by working
terrier enthusiasts in England for more than 100 years.

jack russell terrier~
the Jack Russell terrier~
A Jack Russell terrier is following a scent.
~
   Jack Russell Terriers are a type, or strain, of working terrier.  They are
not purebred in the sense that they have a broad genetic make-up, a broad
standard, and do not breed true to type.  You will see different "types" of
JRTs, from long-bodied, short, crooked legs to a more proportioned length of
body and longer legs.  This is a result of having been bred strictly for hunting
since their beginning in the early 1800's, and their preservation as a working
breed since.

James Stockdale~
A man beaten to the brink of his life stares up at you with powerful eyes.
~
   James Stockdale was shot down by anti-aircraft fire during Vietnam.  He was
held as a POW for seven years.  He spent over half of this time in solitary
confinement in leg irons.  Even being incapacitated he was still able to lead
the POW underground resistance successfully.  For this he was routinely tortured
and beaten resulting in permanent disablement from a repeatedly broken leg,
broken back, and shoulders being wrenched from their sockets.  When his captors
attempted to use him as televised propaganda, he slit his scalp with a razor.
When they covered the cut with a hat he beat himself with a stool until his face
was swollen beyond recognition.  As a final attempt he slit his wrists rather
than allow himself to be used or let down his fellow POWs.  His captors found
him unconscious and near death.  The torture stopped after that and they no
longer attempted to use him.  He received the Medal of Honor for his actions.
