the Mayor of McGintey Cove~
The Mayor of McGintey Cove parades by you.
~
   He looks quite decadent, draped in sheer, golden silk and satin teal
sashes.  He turns his head suddenly to catch a glimpse of a young noblewoman
and you see a small teal ornament hanging loosely from his right ear.  The
trinket looks quite valuable.
