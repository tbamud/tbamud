Farlenian~
Farlenian~
Farlenian the soldier stands and watches quietly.
~
   Farlenian is a dark-haired, blue-eyed man with an extremely grave expression
drawn upon his face.  He wears a bright blue set of overalls, with some
protective layers of leather over top and a white cloak to round it out.  His
crossbow looks well-used and cared for.  You think he knows how to use it.

Koofy gerbil~
Koofy~
A small gerbil is eating some peanuts on a table here.
~
   It's a small, well-groomed and well-cared for brown gerbil.  Its sniffing
around some peanuts quietly, and then promptly shoves the lot of them in its
mouth!

Alerka~
Alerka~
Alerka Bardbane is resting here.
~
   Alerka sneers at you rudely, and ignores you.  He looks rather nondescript
and plain, just an ordinary man taking a break.  His knives do not look
ordinary at all, however.

Drogo~
Drogo~
Drogo the Dwarf is polishing his axe here.
~
   Drogo Bloodstain, dwarf at large.  He polishes his battle axe with a fervor,
more than once licking the blade to put a shine on it.  He seems to be having
fun...  To each his own.

Desslok elf dark~
Desslok~
A dark elf stands against the wall, watching.
~
   You feel his eyes bore through you for a moment, and then whisk away.  He
stands motionless, quietly...  Awaiting a proper moment perhaps?

Airden~
Airden the Wanderer~
Airden the Wanderer is taking a break from wandering here.
~
   Airden is a tall, skinny human, dressed in simple clothes.  He smiles at you
and nods hello.  The dust on his clothes tells tales of many strange lands and
stranger adventures, and for a moment you consider asking him to tell you a
story.

Eshiay woman~
Eshiay~
A young woman sits here, a confused expression upon her face.
~
   Eshiay seems somewhat pretty, but very confused.  She moves a little
awkwardly, as if her body doesn't fit her very well.  She smiles at you
uncertainly, and then ignores you.

Jordo~
Jordo~
Jordo the Engineer is just hanging out here.
~
   Jordo's eyes glint viciously as he looks across the room.  From the way his
hands tighten on his weapon, you can tell that he isn't quite as at ease as he
would like you to believe.

A waiter rushes by, intent on his business.

   He looks harried from the way he hastily takes orders and rushes in the back
to get food, and to the bar for drinks.  He doesn't even spare you a glance as
he passes by.

farmer~
a farmer~
A tired farmer relaxes here, for awhile.
~
   The dust and dirt of the land cover this man head to toe.  His eyes look
weary, his hands calloused, and those big work-boots he's wearing just can't be
comfortable.  This man is one of the citizenry elite; he feeds the people
through his own hard work.  Maybe you should buy him a beer.

Werith~
Werith~
Werith tends bar here, listening but not talking very much.
~
   From the size of those arms, this man must've once been a blacksmith.  You
bet he can more than take on anyone who wants to knock over his wayhouse for a
little cash...  This man is truly immense.  His movements sure, his eyes
keen...  You don't think messing with him would be a good idea.

he mixes a Franjie Deluxe for the guy down the ways a bit, his hands quickly
and surely spinning the lemon over the sides of the glass.
