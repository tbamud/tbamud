A woman wearing a pretty pink taffeta dress trudges along the beach.

   My, what beauty.  But she just gives you a long, doleful stare and without a
sound continues along.  How strange--her eyes are a very dull gray.  Doesn't
seem to work with her beautiful face.

leader harem master~
a fat harem master~
A very fat harem master orders his concubines around.
~
   Gads.  This man must have some kind of magic to be able to keep all of these
women, because he certainly doesn't have the face for it.  He looks somewhat
like a cross between a pear and a potato, but without the good looks.

the Priest of Fear~
The Priest of Fear is walking around, looking rather pompous.
~
   This incredibly strong person doesn't look like the kind of man you'd want
to meet on the street every day.  He certainly inspires fear in your heart.
You'd most likely *NOT* want to attempt to kill this man!  He's one mean
fellow!

the prisoner~
A prisoner, locked up for crimes against Fear, is raving here.
~
   The prisoner looks at you bravely and shouts, "JUST KILL ME!  I DARE YOU!
" He looks totally emaciated, as if he hasn't been fed for weeks.  He is dirty
and almost naked--his rags barely cover him.  He is covered in his own filth.
Just looking at him makes you want to retch.

terror high priest~
the High Priest of Terror~
The High Priest of Terror stands before you in all her majesty.
~
   How shocking!  Out of all the types of people you would expect to see in
this kind of position, you didn't expect to see someone this beautiful and
kind- looking.  She stands about 2 meters tall, and while she is obviously very
strong, she is also quite voluptuous.  She looks at you with the most
sympathetic eyes--you just want to give yourself over to her.

dragon terror~
the Grand Dragon of Terror~
The Grand Dragon of Terror rests, curled around a giant pillar in the temple.
~
   This dragon is just beautiful.  Its scales are mirror-like in polish.
Beautifully-colored wings protrude from the sides.  Unlike most dragons, this
actually resembles a snake--except that it's about one-hundred times larger,
and certainly is more dangerous.  Sharp teeth extend from the mouth, and wisps
of smoke curl from its nose.  It looks at you with infinite intelligence and a
little bit of resignation, as though it knows you will eventually get around to
attacking it.

   The torturer looks stark raving mad, to be frank.  He waves his weapon in
the air with a mad cackle, and looks at you.  With an evil grin, he says, "ah,
my next victim!  Yessssss" and launches himself at you.

his eye.  He looks quite sinister, as though he expects to get information out
of you--whether you know it or not.
