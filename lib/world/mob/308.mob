cailveh baron~
the Baron Cailveh~
The Baron lounges in his favorite chair, reading from a thick book.

   He is a short, stocky man who looks as if he might need a bit of shaping up
to be called 'in shape'.  His eyes are a bit hollowed, as are most men's eyes
spent too long reading from books.  His hair is all but vanished except for two
thin lines on the sides of his head.
