   Jerrod smiles and nods as he passes by, his face set in an expression of
open kindness.  The people who he smiles at, however, smile nervously back,
hoping not to offend in any way.  Jerrod is never petty or unkind to the common
folk of the keep or the surrounding land, but the stories of his tirades on his
men are legendary - thus the reason for the wide berth that people give when he
passes.
