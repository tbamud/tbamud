the stonewrights' assistant~
The assistant to the stonewright is here, ready to sell you some stones.
~
   The stonewrights' assistant is a muscular man, obviously strong from
helping the stonewright with the rocks.  And he obviously has been sent here,
because he's expendable - the stonewright wasn't...

weaponsmith assistant trader~
the weaponsmiths' assistant~
The assistant to the dwarven weaponsmith is ready to do business with you here.
~
   The weaponsmith himself is too valuable to the dwarven community to stand in
these halls.  His assistant, on the other hand, is still a young dwarf, who
knows a little about the making of weapons, but is, as they say in these parts,
worth a dime a dozen.

armorsmith assistant trader~
the armorsmiths' assistant~
The assistant to the Armorsmith is here, showing you his wares.
~
   Having realized how many people with bad intentions come to buy their armor,
the dwarves have decided to only send the assistants to the tradehalls, leaving
the masters i the safety of their workshops.  Thus a young dwarf, no more than
seventy or eighty years old, tends the stall for the armorsmith.  But don't
let his age fool you.  He knows how to wield the hammer to make the armor last.
Having discovered the possibilities in trade, the dwarves have decided to make
the armor in your size too.

guard trade sergeant dwarf~
the sergeant of the trade hall guards~
The sergeant of the guards is patrolling the trade halls, eyeing you suspiciously.
~
   A short look on this dwarf makes you realize he might not actually want to
be here, but has been ordered by his superiors to go around here, almost under
open sky, compared to his warm cosy bunk in the barracks in the town itself.
He seems to be just on the verge of becoming provocative just to get a fight
going.  He still keeps his poor men busy, though.

~
   A scarred war veteran of a dwarf, promoted to the rank of lieutenant, so the
kings guards could use his knowledge in controlling the new recruits, he is the
one to talk to, if you would ever dream of getting inside the city.  Come to
think of it, he looks like he might accept a small bribe, should you be
interested.

Torg~
Torg, the dwarven weaponsmith is pounding while the iron is hot.
~
   A stout and strong dwarf, he resembles every caricature ever made of dwarven
weaponsmiths.  Short, bald and with a long beard, working his head off in the
smoky smithy.  You notice he is very careful about striking at the right angle
with every stroke, and you realize you're standing in front of one of the
masters of forgery, Torg himself.

Ralf~
Ralf, legendary dwarven armorsmith, has gone all but deaf in the noise.
~
   He didn't hear you approaching.  Actually you are quite sure he wouldn't
have heard you if you'd entered mounted on horseback.  He is totally absorbed
in his work, making the armors for future wars.  His stature is that of and
old dwarf, yet he uses his hammer like it was made of air.  Again and again it
pounds on the metal, making those small dents that will strengthen the armor
rather than weaken it.

The dwarven stonewright is making another rock into a headstone.
~
   He looks really strong and you realize he's the one responsible for all of
the headstones on the floor.  He isn't really concentrating at the moment,
though.  It seems he's more interested in keeping an eye on you, making sure
nothing is removed from his workshop.

   You feel confident this dwarf would be a match for you.  Not only does it
take some force to get to the throne of the dwarven kingdom, rich as it is, but
the real trick is staying there.  Many dwarves would like to be the king, so he
has developed a very good technique; If in doubt about your opponents
intentions, force him to understand yours.
