A beautiful woman with fair hair flares angrily up at your intrusion.
~
   Milady de Winter is a slender form draped in white ermine and knowledgeable
in the ways of enchantment.  Golden hair falls to her waist, her eyes are cyan
blue and widened with anger, or perhaps a tinge of fear.  Long presumed dead,
she wears one of many guises and is accustomed to discarding lives.

The black naga guardian is coiled here.
~
   The guardian naga is a serpent-like creature, coal-black scales shield an
elongate body with the head of a woman, and make no sound with her curious
writhing.  It looks intelligent enough to judge whether you are worthy to pass
into the guild of rogues that is its keeping.
