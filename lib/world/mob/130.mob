hopelessness feeling~
a feeling of hopelessness~
A feeling of hopelessness threatens to overcome you.
~
   Depression, hopelessness, fear and anxiety all come together to try and bring
you down.  They threaten to overcome and overpower you.  Separately, each is a
dangerous foe, but together they are near unstoppable.  Perhaps, before they
grow any more in numbers, or torment your soul any further you should just kill
yourself and end your pain.

mist~
the swirling mist~
The swirling mists try to strike out at you!
~
   It looks unfinished.  This stray tendril of a mist seems to come from nowhere
just as it seems to lead nowhere.  But looks can be deceiving.  Something about
the mist beckons and draws you toward it.  Draws you in to it.  Something about
it forces you to wield whatever weapons are at your disposal and defend
yourself.

this is it really suicide?  Or is it murder?  Whatever this is, it is dangerous
and may be the cause of feelings that keep spreading through you and attempting
to drag down your soul.
