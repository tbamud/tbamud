eternity dragon~
the Eternity Dragon~
The Eternity Dragon stands before you, it pays you no heed as it stays its everlasting vigil.
~
   The Eternity Dragon is by far the largest dragon you have ever seen or heard
of.  Its body easily stretching 300 feet from nose to tail.  This entire
cavern, which seems to span the distance of about three levels of this
mountain, is completely filled by the dragon.  At the time it seems peaceful,
but you can tell that attacking it would be the dumbest, and last thing you
ever did.

pixie guard~
a Pixie Guard~
The Pixie Guard stands here, prepared to loose his life for the king.
~
   The Pixie Guard doesn't really do much to inspire fear in your heart, but
you suppose that if pressed, he could fight quite viciously compared to most
Pixies.

the Master Pixie Mage~
The Master Pixie Mage is here ruffling through the King's belongings.
~
   The Master Pixie Mage does not look like any of the other Pixies you have
encountered.  His glow has taken on a pale green color, and he is staring at
you maliciously.  The Staff he carries seems familiar, but you are not sure
from where you remember it.
