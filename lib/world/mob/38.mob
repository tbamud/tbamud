black rat~
the black rat~
A large, scrabby-looking black rat is clawing the ground around here.
~
   It is an oversized black rat.  It is different than the rats of the capital
sewers.  It has shaggy black fur that seems to be slicked down from the sewage
that it lives in.  Its long, gray tail flicks about as it claws the ground with
its large, ugly talons.  It stops clawing just enough to see you and bare its
hideous teeth in a screeching hiss.

slaive~
the corpse of Slaive~
A strange corpse lies here, filling the room with its stench.
~
   It appears to be the corpse of some unfortunate soul whose body was never
found.  The bones seem misshapen in places, and the carcass gives off a nasty
odor.  The corpse seems to be human, but the head has been horribly bashed in.

ugly black rat~
the black rat~
An ugly black rat scurries about, trying to find something to eat.
~
   The hideous rodent is pattering around on its gross claws.  Its black fur is
the most disgusting hair you've ever seen, with deathly looking lice running
through the small pricks of hair.  It has a bald, gray head with a long, white
tail.
