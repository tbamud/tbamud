King Welmar~
The wise King Welmar sits here in his throne.

   In his later middle-age, with his beard starting to gray, King Welmar is
still very powerfully built, and wouldn't take kindly to an attack.  Despite

wise and just ruler.

Peter, the Captain of the Royal Guard, walks around inspecting.

   As all members of the Guard, Peter wears the chain mail required of them as
uniform.  Even though all the other guards seem well trained, you realize none

two meters tall, but still moves with an almost feline grace.  He actually
radiates strength and confidence, and you have to fight a sudden urge to come to
attention as you see him.

Ergan the Murderer~
Slumped in a corner you see Ergan, aka the Murderer of Townsbridge.
~
   You remember a time almost a decade ago, when the news of the day was how
this man had slaughtered the entire population of the little village of
Townsbridge.  He was imprisoned, and here he is - a shadow of the undoubtedly
great warrior he once was, but still to be reckoned with.
