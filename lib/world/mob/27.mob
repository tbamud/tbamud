memlin sad creature small~
a sad-looking memlin~
A small creature digs here with a sad look in its eyes.
~
   This creature is one of the few left of the race of memlins.  Short and
gangly, it looks well suited to life in tunnels.  Its warty skin is the colour
of sand and stone and two large pointed ears twitch at any sound.  Large yellow
eyes seem to fill its face with an expression of despair and helplessness.

a heavily-muscled guard~
A heavily-muscled guard stands here keeping an eye on the surroundings.
~
   This fierce looking guard has the large amber eyes and pointed ears of his
memlin kin, but appears unnaturally muscled and strong.  His face is stern and
grim as though he takes his duties seriously, but his wide eyes betray a sense
of concealed desperation.

A small squeaking bat dives in and out of the shadows.
~
   Flitting about quickly, this bat hardly stays still long enough to be
observed.  Its characteristic black furred body and webbed wings are somewhat
harmless looking until several sharp teeth glint in the subdued light.

a weary memlin~
A weary memlin supervises the handing out of supplies.
~
   His eyes are slightly glassed over and the natural creases of his face are
even more deeply furrowed into an almost constant frown.  Absent-mindedly
shuffling various items into some resemblance of order, he seems scarcely aware
of anyone else's presence.

tiny wish~
a @Ctiny wish@n~
A @Ctiny wish@y floats lazily through the air.
~
   It looks almost like a small wisp of cotton, delicate white strands drifting
out from a spherical body as it floats in the air.  Almost more like a seedling
than an animal, it is easy to forget it is alive, until it hums gently and
drifts deliberately closer.  This creature's mere presence seems to freshen the
air, as though it were somehow filtering and replenishing it.

Startlingly luminous and brimming slightly with tears, they are almost like the
amber eyes of a feline, only unsettlingly vacant.  She seems confused at the
workings of the world around her and draws shyly away on approach.

   This beautiful bird is well-fattened and covered with bright plumage that
makes its efforts at hiding almost laughable.  Its cherry-red face blends into a
warm bespeckled brown that covers most of its body, a brilliant patch of
eggshell blue and light purple fanning out into its tail.

only the faint swishing of robes can be heard as he moves about the room.

Shuffling along on spines that cover its entire body, its gigantic firey mouth
gives it the ability to consume even metals and piles of rubble, making it
useful for excavation sites.  Black smoke rises from the creature, the product
of its constant digestion.

~
   This pathetic looking creature could easily be mistaken for a decaying
skeleton were it not for the rasping sounds of breath that still escape his
mouth.  A single black chain secures his ankle to the wall, though he appears
far beyond any chance for escape or survival.  Paper-thin skin hangs loosely in
folds about his skeletal body, the eerie rattling sound as he struggles for
breath a sure sign of his imminent death.

In fact it seems almost gelatinous, quivering slightly with every vibration and
slowly waving as if by its own accord.  It looks as though there is more to it
than what can be seen protruding from the ice.

currents from its siblings dry it off, making it increasingly capable of
navigating its way through the slight breeze.

   The colour of faded blue egg-shell, this creature makes a faint clacking
sound when it moves as though it is made entirely of bone...  or indeed
egg-shell.  Squinting black eyes peer calculatingly out from an elongated skull
and a hideous toothy smile splits across its face at the sight of you.  Two
gigantic spider-like hands curl protectively around a glowing object in its
lap.

as his skin seems slowly to darken and crack.  His entire lower body has turned
completely into stone, the petrification creeping higher like a black spreading

slightly as peristaltic-like contractions ripple through its body.  Large
amounts of thick black smoke ooze from pores all over its body as it devours the
piles of rubble, ore and all with its massive firey mouth, acting almost as
living waste disposal.

   This powerful creature is most similar in appearance and size to a dragon.  
Massive scale plating cascades smoothly down its back and sides, reptilian skin
polished and gleaming as it moves.  An enormous tail waves slowly and
pendulously from side to side, its clawed feet indenting the almost solid
ground.  Its most unusual feature is its large faintly glowing eyes, uncannily
perceptive they seem to peer through things rather than at them.  The eyes are
of odd colouring too, one glowing bright ember red and the other gleaming
charcoal black.

large blue eyes seem almost eeriely perceptive, shimmering just a little to
brightly to appear normal, vivid splashes of green fading and dying as though
some strange force pulses through them.

he gives an air of formidable confidence and proud fearlessness.

calculating evil.  Cruel black teeth glint like coals amidst the fiery crimson
of her lips, so sharp and pointed as to appear almost feral, her smooth scaled
skin as dark and glossy as slick oil.
