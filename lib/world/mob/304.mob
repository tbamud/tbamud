man taurus~
Taurus~
A man wearing a golden mask watches you.
~
   You look at this man, and then notice something funny.  It seems to be
difficult for him to stand on two legs.  As you watch, he drops to all fours.
You see a glimpse of fur under his cloak.  He peels the mask off and you stare
into his brown eyes, and big, wet, black nose.  "Nice nose ring", you think.
