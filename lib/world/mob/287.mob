innkeeper reilly~
Reilly the Innkeeper~
The innkeeper watches for customers and drinks imported Scotch.
~
   Reilly doesn't keep this inn open by sitting and watching the goblins invade!
He looks more like a hobo than an innkeeper but you can at least see that he is
wearing a huge Scotch sword at his side.  He is also drinking from a huge bottle
of Scotch whiskey, probably not the single-malt variety.

Pater Vinci~
Pater Vinci greets you as you pass by.
~
   Pater Vinci did not bear a weapon in the good old days, but now the goblins
ought to avoid him, because the good priest fought for King Korbor before he
took holy orders, and still carries a sturdy club.

You probably look like a tasty meal.
