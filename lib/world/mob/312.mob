alain longstride man~
Alain Longstride~
Alain Longstride strides about the area, protecting the innocent lepers.
~
   Alain is probably the only man on the island who is not a leper himself.
His mother was sent here when he was a baby.  When he became old enough, he
journied for many months to get to this place.  Upon arrival, he found that she
had already submitted to the Eternal Flame.  Heartbroken, he wept for days.
When he finially came to his senses, he vowed that no leper would ever again be
prosecuted, and so he set about protecting them and their awful home as best he
could.

robed man leper~
a robed leper~
A man in flowing robes sits upon the crest of the volcano, eyes closed in a trance.
~
   He sits cross-legged with his arms resting palms up in his lap.  Looking
down at his hands, you see that two of his fingers are missing.  This man is a
leper!

wild old hermit man leper~
the wild old hermit~
A wild old hermit begins screaming "GET OUT OF MY TREE!!!" as soon as you enter.
~
   This poor man is obviously in the grips of some sort of dillusionary side
affect from his leprosy.

lioness~
a lioness~
A lioness looks up at you with a slow, purring growl and licks her lips.
~
   She is really quite a fine specimen, for a lioness.  The fact that she
appears to be sizing you up in proportion to a dinner plate does not give much
time for admiration, though.

supplicant leper man~
a supplicant leper~
A man riddled with pussing pustules walks vacant-eyed about the area.
~
   He looks neither right nor left as he makes his way to where ever it is that
he is going.  In fact - it doesn't even appear that he looks straight ahead, so
mechanical is his gait.

supplicant leper woman~
a supplicant leper~
A woman stares off into space, no longer caring about much of anything.
~
   Her once-beautiful face is now almost unrecognizable as human.  She is
swathed from head to toe in wet bandages which soak up most of the festering
wounds all over her body.

supplicant leper man~
a supplicant leper~
A terribly diseased man stands at the fence to the pen, gripping the rail.
~
   He does not move nor speak.  He stares into open air, his mouth half open
with the occasional spittle dripping down his chin.

supplicant leper woman~
a supplicant leper~
An awfully disfigured woman walks through the camp, head down.
~
   She does not look up, even when she stumbles over something.  She simply
wanders this small area in hopelessness.

dying man leper~
a dying leper~
A dying leper lies amid stained sheets and cloths, gasping his last breathes.
~
   His face is beyond description, the disease having such a hold on him that
it is a wonder why he has not been thrown to the Sternal Flame as of yet.

boa constrictor~
a boa constrictor~
A boa constrictor lazily unwinds from a tree branch, eyeing you thoughtfully.
~
   It is roughly eight feet in length and it does not look all that fat right
now.  It might be a good idea to sort of back up - real slow-like.

wild boar~
a wild boar~
A wild boar snorts a couple of times and then lowers its tusks.
~
   The snorting, the lowering of the tusks.  It seems to spark a small rule of
thumb for wild boars...

argus leper man~
Argus~
Argus walks about the area, tidying up here and there.
~
   For a leper, keeping things clean and organized is a way of prolonging life.
Most of their extremities are numbed or missing, making it easy to receive a
wound without noticing it.

Jantry woman leper~
Jantry~
Jantry hums an old ballad as she rakes the garden slowly and deliberately.
~
   Jantry is the resident in charge of keeping the garden plentiful and free of
disease - a very important job which she herself takes quite seriously.  This
garden is the area's main source and backup for foodstuffs when the Lord of
Jareth runs into snags or delays in sending shipments.

crazed half naked leper man~
a crazed half-naked man~
A crazed, half-naked man leaps from behind a tree, assaulting you with a cry.
~
   He wears only a short loin cloth, which would be terrible enough all by
itself, but the fact that he is a leper with pussy pustules all over his body
is enough to make even the most stalwart of men retch in agony.
