zombie~
a zombie~
A brain dead zombie is here, drooling all over himself.
~
   It was once a corpse but has somehow been brought back to life.  It's very
slow and very stupid.  It looks back at you and says 'fooooooood.  '

undertaker~
the undertaker~
The undertaker is standing here, leaning on his shovel.
~
   He looks back at you and spits on the ground.  He's dressed in dirty
overalls and wears a Midgaard ball cap.  He was once an adventurer but decided
to dig graves instead of ascending to immortality.  You'd best keep out of his
way.

priest~
the priest~
The chapel priest is standing here, conducting service.
~
   He is a very pious man.  Fat, balding and truly someone that you would think
of as "father".  He stands at the podium and lectures over some drivel that you
really don't care about.

boy~
the altar boy~
An altar boy sits here, bored out of his mind.
~
   He looks extremely bored and extremely tired.  He looks at the priest
through the corner of his eyes as if he's expecting another flogging at any
moment.

ghoul~
the nasty ghoul~
A nasty ghoul is here, and it wants to eat you for dinner.
~
   Its claws are filthy, its fangs look sharp.  Fresh blood drips down the side
of its face, probably the remains of whatever it caught last.

wight~
the wight~
The barrow wight is here standing atop a pile of decaying corpses.
~
   It is the most hideous creature you have ever seen.  It's covered from head
to toe in a thick blanket of dirt.  Its claws look very nasty and the mere
thought of being struck by them sends shivers up and down your spine.

skeleton warrior~
the skeleton warrior~
A mean looking skeleton warrior is here grinning at you.
~
   There's no flesh on it at all -- just bones covered by armor.  You wonder
what kind of forces keep it from collapsing into a heap on the floor.

weak.

the mummy~
A rotting mummy wrapped in dirty cloth is here.
~
   It looks ancient.  The rank smell of decay reeks from its body.  Worms crawl
in its eye sockets and pus drips from between bandages.

the wailing banshee~
A banshee is here, leaning on a sarcophagus and crying loudly.
~
   Even undead, she is quite beautiful.  Tears streak down her high, elven
cheek bones.  You wonder why she is so upset.

the transparent spectre~
You glance right through the spectre and see the wall on the other side.
~
   You see the faint outline of a man.  You see right through him, and judging
by the way he's coming after you, he'd like to see through you.

An undead spider is here, spinning more cobwebs.

moves about on its thin legs and still spins its ghostlike cobwebs.
