the lag monster~
The lag monster stands here looking confused.  Kill him!  Kill him!

   What an odd looking little beast.  He looks harmless, but you never can
tell.  He is only about 4 feet tall, but he pretty muscular looking...  Maybe
you should ask if he needs help?  Nah...  Kill him.

lag baby~
the baby lag~
Someone's little pet lag has gotten loose, and is sniffing about here.
~
   Awwww...  How cute!  A little baby lag.  He's about 3 feet long and you just
want to cuddle him to death...  No, you really want to kill him to tell the
truth.  But, remember, even a little lag can be a big problem.

the lag Guard~
The lag Guard is here wondering where that lag went.
~
   The Guard also had the job of taking care of the court jester's pet lag, but
he doesn't seem to be doing a good job of it.  He looks at you and says, 'Have
you seen that lag?  Master will have my head if I don't find him.  '

into the shadows.

   A massive man, with the head of a bull.  He looks as strong as bull too, but
not nearly as smart.  Actually, now that you consider it...  He looks a heck of
a lot meaner than any bull you have ever seen...  And he is coming this way!
