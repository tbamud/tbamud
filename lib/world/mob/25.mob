A large calico cat is lounging about here.

   It looks incredibly large for a cat, no doubt a giant of its species.  A
beautiful jewel encrusted collar about its neck is its only adornment.

the Grand Mistress~
The Grand Mistress of Magic is sitting here.

   She looks quite comfortable on her emerald throne.  Amazingly young and
pretty for one of such stature in the guild, no doubt she has kept her youthful
appearance through the use of strong magicks.  The Grand Mistress pets her
familiar and smiles at you in confidence.
