cpu~
a cpu~
There is a large Pentium-166Mhz processor here.
~
   This is a *huge* processor.  It dwarfs everything you've seen so far.  The
pins are huge, the cooling fan could probably chop a human in two.  The heat
given off by something of that size is ungodly, you are sweating heavily under
your armor.
