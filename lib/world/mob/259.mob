fetch undead spectre~
the Fetch~
A Fetch, dressed in black tattered robes which seem to float about its body, stands here.
~
   A Fetch can mean one thing and one thing only - someone is going to die.
The primary function of a Fetch is to foretell death.  The question is - is this
Fetch foretelling your death, or someone else's?

mother spectre ghost~
the Spectre of a Woman~
A womanish spectre floats through the manse, her eyes crying blood.

   Her sad eyes tell a story of loss and regret, an anguish as ancient as this
home, possibly even older.  She constantly wrings her hands, looking about as if
in search for someone or something.

web spiderweb~
a sticky spiderweb~
A sticky spiderweb lunges out at you, trying to draw you into its web.
~
   It is a very intricate and thick pattern that has been woven here, you could
stare at it for hours and travel its full length.  Strange, it seems almost as
if it might have just moved...

churel woman moaning~
the churel~
A moaning churel floats through the house, weeping for all the lost children.
~
   Its feet seem a bit askew, almost as if they were turned backward on the
ankles, and the constant moaning is enough to drive a crazy man sane.

phantom howling~
a Howling Phantom~
A howling Phantom floats through the halls, looking for others to join it in its eternal Hell.
~
   You can not distinguish any specific features of this terrible force of evil,
only a vague humanish shape, baleful glowing eyes, and what appears to a flowing
robe cloak all about it.

rat scurrying~
a scurrying rat~
A rat scurries across the floor in front of you.
~
   With its short, stubby hairs all raised on its back and its tail ramrod
straight, you would almost think this rat meant to attack you!  Best not to find
out - better kill it.
