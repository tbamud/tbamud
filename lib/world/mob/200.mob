   She definitely looks like she's had better days.  It looks as if she has not
bathed or eaten for several days.  You smell her long before and after you see
her.  She hobbles along aimlessly.

mother bear~
an angry black bear~
A huge black bear crashes through the brush as you approach.
~
   The thick black fur covering this massive animal can bring a good price if
you can kill it, and find a fur trader.  Unfortunately, bears are not an easy
kill.  They are even known to become aggressive when cornered or protecting
their young.

the soaked captain~
The soaked captain is drying off here.
~
   Once a captain of a barge that would travel down the river.  His boat seemed
to have ran afoul on some rocks and he barely was able to SWIM for his life.

like he did.
