%s Terribly sorry, I don't have one of those, but I have a poem about one.  Would you like to hear it?~
%s Don't you know Goethe knows all?  Sell me something you have.~
%s Get a clue!  Try the store next door.  Non-poets can't stand them.~
%s I've spent all my money to feed all the hungry artists in the world.  I can't afford that.~
%s Sorry, you can't afford that, but you can afford a copy of 'Goethe: the poet's early years' (autographed version).~
%s That will cost you %d coins.  And with that fine purchase you recieve a free copy of 'Goethe: Mere Genius or God.'~
%s Money is but transient ether.  I will buy it for %d coins.~
